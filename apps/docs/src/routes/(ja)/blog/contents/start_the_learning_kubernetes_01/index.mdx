# Background

I want to learn how to use Kubernetes (undefined)
But, I have other things I want to do (app development) so I'll put it off~
So, I'm going to seriously try to use Kubernetes, which I haven't really learned until now. ✨

# Environment

```
iMac (21.5-inch, 2017)
```

My knowledge level is,
"I know Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool," and I've heard related terms, but I don't understand them well.

# Where to start?

It seems easier and simpler to start with the managed service GKE. 😍

## GKE SetUp

  layout="constrained"

Nodes are the machines that hold pods (containers), right? ([Pod and Node](https://nownabe.github.io/kubernetes-doc/tutorials/kubernetes_basics/3_explore_your_app.html))

  height={731}
  layout="constrained"
  alt="GKE Standard Cluster Template 2"
/>

Well, the default is fine, right? 🤔

  height={720}
  layout="constrained"
  alt="GKE Standard Cluster Template 3"
/>

I don't understand any of the words...(Istio? Auto-provisioning? Vertical pod auto-scaling?) 🤔🤔🤔

# Let's learn on Mac where we can try Kubernetes...

It's a waste to run GKE in a state where I don't understand the meaning, because it costs money and I don't know what I'm doing.
It seems that Kubernetes can be used on Docker For Mac, so I think I'll start learning there... 💪

The next one is [here](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_02/index.mdx).
