# Last time

In [Starting to learn Kubernetes a step behind - 13. Health checks and container lifecycle -](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_13/index.mdx), we learned about health checks such as requests and limits. This time, we will learn about scheduling through Affinity and others.

# Scheduling

The scheduling we are about to learn can be broadly classified into two types.

- How to select a specific Node at the time of Pod scheduling
  - Affinity
  - Anti-Affinity
- How to mark a Node as tainted and only allow Pods that can tolerate it to be scheduled
  - Taint = Taints
  - Tolerance = Tolerations

# Checking Node Labels

Let's take a look at the labels of the Node that are set by default.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get nodes -o json | jq ".items[] | .metadata.labels"
{
  "beta.kubernetes.io/arch": "arm",
  "beta.kubernetes.io/os": "linux",
  "kubernetes.io/arch": "arm",
  "kubernetes.io/hostname": "raspi001",
  "kubernetes.io/os": "linux",
  "node-role.kubernetes.io/master": ""
}
{
  "beta.kubernetes.io/arch": "arm",
  "beta.kubernetes.io/os": "linux",
  "kubernetes.io/arch": "arm",
  "kubernetes.io/hostname": "raspi002",
  "kubernetes.io/os": "linux",
  "node-role.kubernetes.io/worker": "worker"
}
{
  "beta.kubernetes.io/arch": "arm",
  "beta.kubernetes.io/os": "linux",
  "kubernetes.io/arch": "arm",
  "kubernetes.io/hostname": "raspi003",
  "kubernetes.io/os": "linux",
  "node-role.kubernetes.io/worker": "worker"
}
```

It seems that arch and os are set by default.
For future learning, let's label them.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k label node raspi002 cputype=low disksize=200
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k label node raspi003 cputype=low disksize=300
```

# NodeSelector

This is the simplest NodeAffinity setting.
It schedules to assign Pods to Nodes that belong to the specified label. Because it's simple, it can only specify equality-base.

Now, let's place a Pod on a Node (raspi003) with a disksize of 300.

```yaml
# sample-nodeselector.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-nodeselector
  labels:
    app: sample-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:1.12
  nodeSelector:
    disksize: "300"
```

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-nodeselector.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get pods sample-nodeselector -o wide
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP             NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-nodeselector   1/1     Running   0          21s   10.244.2.130   raspi003   <none>           <none>
```

It's as expected. OK.
nodeSelector can only be expressed in equals, so it lacks flexibility.

# Affinity

Affinity can be set more flexibly than NodeSelector. In other words, it's a set-based specification method.
For more details, please refer to [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-based-requirement). This time we will use the In operator.

```yaml
# sample-node-affinity.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: disktype
                operator: In
                values:
                  - hdd
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
          preference:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
                operator: In
                values:
                  - raspi002
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:1.12
```

In NodeAffinity, you can set two: required and preferred.

- required
  - Mandatory scheduling policy
- preferred
  - Scheduling policy to be considered preferentially

The mandatory condition is "Node (raspi002, raspi003) with cputype=low", and the preferred condition is "Node with hostname=raspi002".
Let's apply it.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-node-affinity.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get pods sample-node-affinity -o wide
NAME                   READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE   IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-node-affinity   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s    <none>   raspi002   <none>           <none>
```

Indeed, it was placed on raspi002. So, what happens if raspi002 cannot be scheduled?

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k delete -f sample-node-affinity.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k cordon raspi002
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-node-affinity.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get pods sample-node-affinity -o wide
NAME                   READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE   IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-node-affinity   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          11s   <none>   raspi003   <none>           <none>
```

This time, since raspi002 was cordoned, it moved to raspi003. It's preferred, so it's okay if it's not met. If the mandatory condition is not met, it will be Pending.

Let's return it to the original.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k delete -f sample-node-affinity.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k uncordon raspi002
```

## AND and OR

nodeSelectorTerms and matchExpressions are arrays, so you can specify multiple.

```yaml
# sample.yaml
nodeSelectorTerms:
  - matchExpressions:
      - A
      - B
  - matchExpressions:
      - C
      - D
```

In the above case, it becomes a condition of (A and B) OR (C and D).

# Anti-Affinity

Anti-Affinity is the opposite of Affinity. In other words, it schedules to assign to Nodes other than a specific Node. There is no special specification, it is simply the negative form of Affinity. It's just a matter of words.

# Inter-Pod Affinity

This is a policy for scheduling Pods on the domain where a specific Pod is running.
It can bring Pods closer together, which can reduce latency.

First, a specific Pod is the one used in the NodeSelector we used earlier.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-node-affinity.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get pods sample-nodeselector -o wide
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP             NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-nodeselector   1/1     Running   0          36m   10.244.2.130   raspi003   <none>           <none>
```

```yaml
# sample-pod-affinity-host.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod-affinity-host
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                  - sample-app
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:1.12
```

With this, the sample-app assigns Pods to the same Node as kubernetes.io/hostname(=raspi003) where it is. In other words, it should be possible on raspi003.

```
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-pod-affinity-host.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $  k get pods sample-pod-affinity-host -o wide
NAME                       READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE   IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-pod-affinity-host   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          11s   <none>   raspi003   <none>           <none>
```

As expected, it was created on raspi003.
In addition to required, you can also set preferred.

```yaml
# sample-pod-affinity-arch.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-pod-affinity-arch
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                  - sample-app
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/arch
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - weight: 1
          podAffinityTerm:
            labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
                - key: app
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - sample-app
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:1.12
```

The mandatory conditions are as follows:

- "On the Node(raspi003) where the Pod with the label app=sample-app is running, kubernetes.io/arch is the same Node(arm)"

This applies to both raspi002(arm) and raspi003(arm).
And the preferred condition is as follows:

- "On the Node(raspi003) where the Pod with the label app=sample-app is running, kubernetes.io/hostname is the same Node(raspi003)"

This should select raspi003.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-pod-affinity-arch.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get pods sample-pod-affinity-arch -o wide
NAME                       READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE   IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-pod-affinity-arch   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          13s   <none>   raspi003   <none>           <none>
```

As expected, it is running on raspi003.

# Inter-Pod Anti-Affinity

This is the negation of Inter-Pod Affinity. That's all.

The Affinity, AntiAffinity, Inter-Pod Affinity, and Inter-Pod AntiAffinity introduced so far can be combined.

# Taints

This taints the Node. Only Pods that tolerate the tainted Node can be scheduled.

There are three types of taints (Effects):

- PreferNoSchedule
  - Avoid scheduling as much as possible
- NoSchedule
  - Do not schedule (Pods already scheduled remain as they are)
- NoExecute
  - Do not allow execution (Pods already scheduled will be stopped)

Now, let's first taint the Node.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k taint node raspi003 env=prd:NoSchedule
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k describe node raspi003 | grep Taints
Taints:             env=prd:NoSchedule
```

This has made it impossible to schedule Pods on raspi003.

# Tolerations

Let's create Pods that can tolerate the Node we just tainted.

Only Pods with the key and value(env=prd) and Effect(NoSchedule) set are allowed. Let's create one.

```yaml
# sample-tolerations.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sample-tolerations
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:1.12
  tolerations:
    - key: "env"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "prd"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    disksize: "300"
```

※ I have set the nodeSelector to specify the tainted Node, raspi003.

There are two types of operators:

- Equal
  - The key and value are equal
- Exists
  - The key exists

Now, let's apply it.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k apply -f sample-tolerations.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k get pod sample-tolerations -o=wide
NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP             NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
sample-tolerations   1/1     Running   0          27s   10.244.2.140   raspi003   <none>           <none>
```

A Pod that can tolerate the tainted Node has been applied.
If you change the toleration part (env=stg), it will of course become Pending.

Let's return it to the original state.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k taint node raspi003 env-
```

# Cleanup

```shell
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k delete -f sample-nodeselector.yaml -f sample-node-affinity.yaml -f sample-pod-affinity-host.yaml -f sample-pod-affinity-arch.yaml -f sample-tolerations.yaml
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k label node raspi002 cputype- disksize-
pi@raspi001:~/tmp $ k label node raspi003 cputype- disksize-
```

# Finally

We have learned how to schedule Pods to which Node.
The concept of taints and tolerations is interesting.
However, if you use it too much, it seems easy to fall into complexity, so be careful.
Next time, it is [here](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_15/index.mdx).
