# Last time

In [Starting to Learn Kubernetes Late - 10. config&storage Part 1 -](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_10/index.mdx), we learned about config. This time, we will learn about storage.

# Volume and PresistentVolume

A Volume refers to a predetermined available volume. You cannot delete or create new volumes here.
PresistentVolume refers to a persistent volume located externally. Here, you can delete or create new volumes.
For stateful things like DB, use PresistentVolume.
For temporary things, do you use Volume?

※ PresistentVolumeClaim is a resource for assigning PresistentVolume.

# Types of Volume

The types of Volume introduced in the book (Kubernetes Complete Guide) are as follows:

- emptyDir
  - Uses temporary disk space
  - When the pod is deleted, emptyDir is also deleted
  - Cannot specify the mount destination
- hostPath
  - A version of emptyDir where you can specify the mount destination
- downwardAPI
  - Mounts a file that has placed Pod information as a file
- projected
  - Creates a directory that combines secret/configMap/downwardAPI/serviceAccountToken and mounts it

※ [types-of-volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes)

Since you can't keep the Volume, you have to be careful when deleting the Pod.
If you save logs as files, is it good to have a temporary Volume?
However, you have to regularly move it to external storage, which is a hassle.
(After all, it's best to stream logs and flow them to an external service)

As a product, there's not much use...?

# Types of PresistentVolume

Use an external persistent volume. For example, the following types are available:

- GCE Persistent Disk
- AWS Elastic Block Store
- NFS
- iSCSI
- Ceph
- OpenStack Cinder
- GlusterFS

In [Starting to Learn Kubernetes Late - 06. workloads Part 2 -](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_06/index.mdx), we used NFS.
The method of creating a PersistentVolume varies depending on the external persistent volume, but there seem to be common points, so I'll write about them here.

- Label
  - Make it easier to specify by labeling the PersistentVolume
- Capacity
  - The capacity required by the Volume. Assigned from the smallest capacity.
- Access Mode
  - ReadWriteOnce
    - Read/Write is possible from a single node
  - ReadOnlyMany
    - Read is possible from multiple nodes
  - ReadWriteMany
    - Read/Write is possible from multiple nodes
- Reclaim Policy
  - Policy on whether to discard or reuse the Volume after use
    - Delete
      - Delete the entity of the PersistentVolume
    - Retain
      - Keep the entity of the PersistentVolume without leaving it
      - Not mounted again
    - Recycle
      - Delete the data of the PersistentVolume and make it reusable
      - Mounted again
      - (Scheduled to be abolished, use DynamicProvisioning)
- StorageClass
  - The type of storage provided by each provider
    - Basically, it is created automatically

# PersistentVolumeClaim

In fact, to use PresistentVolume, you need to make a request with PresistentVolumeClaim.
The necessary items are as follows:

- Label Selector
  - Filtering by label
- Capacity
  - The capacity you are asking for
- Access Mode
  - Refer to the Access Mode of PresistentVolume
- StorageClass
  - Refer to the StorageClass of PresistentVolume

If the Volume that meets the requirements was RetainPolicy, it will become "Released" when the Claim is deleted.

# Finally

This time, it felt like I just wrote the book as it is.
What I actually tried is [Starting to learn Kubernetes a step behind - 06. workloads part 2 -](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_06/index.mdx).
Well, I thought it would be better not to get too deeply involved.
Next time is [here](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_12/index.mdx).
