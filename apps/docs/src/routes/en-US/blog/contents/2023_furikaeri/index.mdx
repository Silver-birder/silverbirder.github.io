It suddenly got cold, didn't it?
Just a week ago, I could get by in short sleeves, but now heating is essential.
We're already halfway through November, and there's not much left of this year. So, I'd like to look back at 2023.

## My First Shinkansen Commute

I wanted a new challenge based in Nagoya, so I used the internal transfer system to move to Nagoya.
Since I live in Kansai, I had to commute by Shinkansen.
At that time, I lived near a Shinkansen station, and it took about an hour door to door.

I rarely ride the Shinkansen, so it was incredibly fresh.
Due to various circumstances, I needed to keep the fare low, so I used a service called "Plat Kodama".
One of the services included a free drink ticket, so I always bought "Mick Chuchu Juice". (It's delicious)

I rarely ride the Shinkansen, so it was a very fresh experience.
Due to various circumstances, I needed to save on the fare, so I used a service called "Plat Kodama",
and enjoyed "Mick Chuchu Juice" with the free drink ticket.

On the train, I would gaze at the scenery outside and organize my thoughts.
Unfortunately, the Shinkansen Super Hard Ice was not sold on board.

Commuting to Nagoya was a first-time experience in my life, and trying local specialties was also one of the pleasures.
In the early days, I would buy souvenirs and go home every time.

The team members based in Nagoya were wonderful people with good personalities and high technical skills.
Highly capable individuals cooperated with each other, complementing each other's shortcomings.
Through training camps and drinking parties, we had fun talking about trivial things and felt nostalgic.
I want to visit BUCYO Coffee again...!

## I Got a Single-Family Home

I was given a used house from my grandparents, located just a 5-minute walk from the house where I lived as a child.

I no longer needed to pay rent, and the property tax was only a few tens of thousands of yen per year, which allowed me to save a lot.
However, because it is located in a somewhat rural area, it is inconvenient to move without a car, and commuting by electric bicycle has become a daily routine.

The place where the house is located is full of memories from my childhood, and I was able to immerse myself in nostalgia.
Conversations with the neighbors increased, and we often got excited about old stories.
(I once climbed the fence of a neighbor's garden... I'm sorry!)

There are also problems unique to old houses, such as being hot in summer and cold in winter.
Furthermore, insects such as cockroaches, spiders, and mosquitoes appear in the house, so insect repellent spray is always available throughout the house. (laughs)

In my hometown, many of my old friends have moved to the city, and there are many elderly people.
However, I spend quality time with my sister's family and my wife's relatives, enjoying games, going out to eat delicious food.

## My First Freelance Experience

After many changes, I quit my full-time job and started my career as a freelancer. As a freelancer, I can freely choose my working hours and days, and I work 3 days a week, devoting the rest of my time to hobbies and housework.

I registered with "Findy Freelance" through a job change service called "Findy", and was able to get projects from there. After interviewing with several companies, I was able to start working successfully. I am very grateful for the detailed guidance I received on the knowledge and procedures necessary for freelancing.

At Findy, I also used a service called user success interviews, and had irregular interviews for about 5 months. This allowed me to receive objective advice and deeply understand my self-analysis and strengths and weaknesses.

One of the first things I faced as a freelancer was the hassle of dealing with health insurance and national pension procedures. I had to manage these matters myself, which I had not been aware of during my full-time employment, and I also had to research tax deductions, business registration, and blue tax returns.

I had to do things that the company used to do for me, which made me realize the convenience of it. Still, I feel personal growth by handling new responsibilities and tasks myself.

Working as a freelancer at various companies and gaining new technologies and knowledge is very attractive. There are plenty of new discoveries and learnings by learning the design techniques of different companies. I am re-realizing the charm of working in various places.

By the way, I managed to change jobs as a full-time employee in December this year. I will be going to the office 5 days a week at a home meal service company. After experiencing remote work, I felt that going to the office suits me. There are limited companies in Kansai where I can go to the office, so this opportunity is valuable. Also, there is a sense of security in the new workplace because there is a person I respect who I worked with in the past.

## My First Car Purchase

The trigger for buying a car was when I returned to my wife's parents' home in Shizuoka in the summer. The area is a car society, and I was always being driven by my wife's family, and I started to want to drive myself. I had a license that I obtained when I was a college student, but I was a gold paper driver who didn't use it.

I visited several dealers with my father to choose a car, and test drove with my father. Thanks to my father's enthusiastic price negotiation, I was able to get a discount of nearly 200,000 yen. (It seems that the meaning of "study for me" that my father said was a discount) As a result, I was able to buy a new light car!!

I was not confident in driving, so I took a paper driver course once, and then continued to practice with my father's car until delivery. Thanks to that, driving has now become one of my pleasures. My range of activities has expanded, and I am driving to places I couldn't go when I was a child with my wife. I'm still struggling with parking, but I'm gradually improving by using parking assist.

## Goals for Next Year

There were many events this year, but I'm looking forward to what kind of year next year will be.
I want to get used to my new workplace, slowly progress with my work, and spend a relaxing time at home.

I have been avoiding overseas travel due to the impact of the Corona disaster, but I am thinking of going abroad next year.
Also, I am looking forward to improving my driving skills and going on long trips.

I would be happy if I could have a child, but I am already quite happy with my current environment, so I want to proceed without pushing myself too hard.
On the technical side, there are a few things I want to create, so I want to realize them and occasionally update my blog.
Also, I am thinking that it might be good to acquire qualifications like ISTQB and JSTQB.

## In conclusion

Thank you for reading to the end.
