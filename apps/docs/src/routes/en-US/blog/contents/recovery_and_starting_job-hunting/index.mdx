At the end of June 2023, I fell ill, but fortunately, I was able to recover after a two-month rest. In response to this recovery, I decided to resume activities at a new workplace and started job hunting as a full-time employee. This article summarizes the events of the past two months and the expected answers to interview questions.

â€» For more details about the background and details of my illness, please refer to [I quit my full-time job](../left_my_full-time_job/index.mdx) if you are interested.

## Health History

From July 2023, I implemented the following measures to regain my health.

- Morning walks and gym visits
- Interaction with friends and relatives
- Eating favorite foods and sweets
- Going on trips
- Programming, which is my hobby

These activities increased my smiles and improved my sleep. (Thank you, Pokemon Sleep)

I received comments from many people that I looked brighter. I am very happy that my health improved naturally without relying on medication.

Also, my grandmother's surgery was successful, and I am relieved about that.
Previously, I was stressed due to the burden of caregiving, but now I am relieved because of my grandmother's recovery.

## History of Contract Work

Since mid-July 2023, I have been working full-time remote work three days a week as a contractor. The initial motivation for choosing contract work was to work flexibly while considering my health. However, now I have gotten into the rhythm of work and can clearly separate ON/OFF. In the process of functional development, I was able to receive valuable feedback from customers and praise from team members for my "careful text communication", and I was able to regain confidence in my abilities. As a result, I was able to return to working at full strength.

## Contract Work or Full-Time Employment

When my health stabilized, I discussed with my wife whether to continue the path of contract work or aim for full-time employment.

Contract work has the advantage of flexible income and the freedom to decide the amount of work. On the other hand, it involves the hassle of filing tax returns and handling insurance premiums, and the lack of compensation, which requires you to research and respond on your own. Working as a full-time employee, on the other hand, restricts freedom compared to contract work, but has the advantage of stable income and comprehensive benefits.

As a result of discussions with my wife, we decided to prioritize **stable income and benefits**, especially support for child-rearing and health. From there, we decided to start job hunting with the aim of pursuing a career as a full-time employee. The experience of working as a contractor made me feel the value of working as a full-time employee anew.

I am deeply grateful to the company I am currently working for. Of course, I am considering a full-time position at this company, but I am also looking for a full-time position at other companies.

## Answers to Interview Questions

I will organize the answers to frequently asked questions during interviews. This is to clarify my own thoughts and to convey them appropriately to the interviewers.

### About the Industry of Interest

I do not have a specific industry of interest. Mainly, solving user problems and challenges is my motivation to work.

In my past experience, I have mainly focused on product development for B2B, prioritizing problem solving for corporate users.
Programming and technology are means to solve problems, and I often solve problems first and then refactor and review the architecture.

I have also been actively involved in helping my colleagues at work, especially engineers, reduce their stress.
Examples include speeding up CI, automating tests, and maintaining documentation.

In other words, I am motivated by "solving problems for people" rather than a specific industry, and I think any industry is fine as long as it is chosen from this perspective.
However, industries that I have no interest or concern in are excluded from the options.

### About the Job Type

In my career so far, I have extensive experience as a web engineer. Therefore, I am hoping for a position related to web application development. I have experience in front-end, back-end, infrastructure, and data platform areas, but I am particularly good at **web front-end development**. Also, in terms of personality, I am defensive and want to excel in quality and operation.

### About Career Vision

#### So far

I joined Sler Corporation as a new graduate in 2016 and was involved in the development, maintenance, and operation of web applications. I experienced a wide range of tasks from upstream to downstream processes. Then in 2018, I transferred to a major EC company. Here, as a full-stack engineer, I was able to experience various things such as data, infrastructure, and applications. I also contributed to the re-architecture and modernization of large-scale applications. In 2022, I changed jobs to a FinTech company and worked on the renovation of existing products and the development of new products as a front-end engineer.

Detailed information is available in my work history. If you are interested, please let me know via [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/silverbirder).

#### From now on

##### Vision

I aim to be a web engineer who can **enrich users' lives through web technology**.

###### Career

As a front-end expert, I want to contribute to feature development while improving the quality of the front-end by utilizing knowledge of testing and DevOps.

I value the perspectives of users and developers and want to proceed with my work with a policy of improving the experience of both. Not only the front-end, but I also want to design and develop projects from a full-stack perspective and from the experience of maintenance and operation.

I have no experience as a manager. I want to deepen my expertise as an engineer and build up my skills. It's not that I'm absolutely against being a manager, but I would consider it if it's a small team.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Strengths in Hard Skills

I have full-stack experience and have handled a variety of projects from new product development to maintenance and operation of large-scale apps, contract development, and in-house service development. From these experiences, I am good at designing and building systems that support efficient operation. In particular, I have consciously created an environment that supports smooth work for the entire team, not just developers, but also designers, QA, and PdM.

Specifically, it is as follows.

- Cooperated with backend engineers to improve API performance
- Established operation policies for Storybook and Figma with designers
- Formulated a test automation strategy in collaboration with QA
- Documented product specifications in collaboration with PdM
  - Furthermore, ensured the functionality expected by PdM using ATDD
- Strengthened CI to reduce toil

I have experienced many re-architectures and refactoring activities. The reason I was involved in these activities a lot is because I thought it was necessary to carry out the necessary work in advance, looking ahead to the future from the perspective of maintenance and operation.

#### Strengths in Soft Skills

**The ability to output what I have learned and what I want to convey as text** is my strength. I am good at organizing and sharing my thoughts and learnings by putting them into sentences. I have experience writing technical articles and technical books. This skill is particularly important in asynchronous communication and full remote work environments. Also, by leaving logs and evidence as text, it is possible to efficiently share progress and problems.

#### Weaknesses in Hard Skills

Although I have a wide range of experience, I have little experience in a specific field. To compensate for this, I want to deepen my experience in the front-end field. For example, testing, DevOps, architecture, etc.

#### Weaknesses in Soft Skills

**I tend to be shy**. Especially in a remote work environment, where the background information of the interlocutor is limited, I am not good at talking to someone I don't know details about other than their name. However, once I can communicate, there is no problem in building relationships afterwards.

### People I want to work with / People I don't want to work with

#### People I want to work with

##### People who open their knowledge

I believe that **actively opening and sharing the knowledge and experience I have learned** can lead to new insights and feedback. It leads to self-growth, and I think it also leads to the growth of the team, organization, and community.

##### People who are wet rather than dry

I prefer **wet communication over dry communication**.
Dry communication is communication that focuses on the transmission of information.
On the other hand, wet communication is communication that includes not only the transmission of information but also emotions and thoughts. It includes thanks, encouragement, empathy, understanding, etc.
I believe it is important to understand and empathize with the feelings and thoughts of others through wet communication.
Therefore, I want to work with people who prefer wet communication.

#### People I Don't Want to Work With

##### Those who work silently

When you keep information to yourself and proceed with your work, opportunities for sharing progress, discussing problems, and helping each other decrease. Even if only the results are communicated, if the process is unclear, it becomes difficult to provide appropriate support. I believe that the process should be shared, even if it is a concise log.

### Major Achievements and Challenges So Far

#### Improving the Search on EC Sites during the Corona Crisis

With the Corona crisis, I was responsible for the design, release, and operation of a feature that displays real-time inventory information for suddenly popular products (e.g., toilet paper and masks). The project was proposed by a senior colleague with extensive experience, and I proceeded with the design under their guidance. I created a Design Doc to clarify the system requirements and implemented it on the front end based on that document. This feature made it possible to update the inventory information of frequently sold-out products from the CMS. This project was a **race against time**, and it was released in just about 2 weeks. The biggest challenge was understanding the search logic, which was complex for me at the time, but I was able to overcome it with the support of my senior colleague.

#### Large-Scale Front-End Re-Architecture

I carried out a large-scale re-architecture of the front end over a period of more than a year, with the aim of addressing Python's EOL. I was in charge of the particularly important search page. Understanding the functionality of the existing pages and introducing a new clean architecture took a lot of time, but we were successful thanks to continuous communication with team members.

#### A Burning Project in a Contract

I participated in a project as a new graduate and experienced all phases from the initial development to the end. Frequent changes in customer requirements and development under tight deadlines posed many challenges. However, with the cooperation of my colleagues and other departments, we were able to move the project forward. As a result, the app was completed. The details of the delivery are unknown.

### Team Development Experience

I have experience in teams in agile development. There is a unification of understanding and sharing of skills in pair programming, which leads to efficiency in later reviews. In PullRequest reviews, I am conscious of the quality of feedback and value the following points.

- Reviewee
  - Detailed Description
  - Small changes focused on one task
  - Use of comments
- Reviewer
  - Incorporating praise and fun (e.g., giphy or emoji)
  - Temperature of feedback (IMO/FYI/MUST)
  - Delegating mechanical checks to CI
  - Providing visual information (videos, photos, code)

In order to make information open to the team, I try to create various documents.

- Meeting minutes
- Operation manual: Run Book
- Design document: Design Doc
- Design change history: Architectural Decision Records

### Communication

I communicate in two ways: text and video.

- Text Communication
  - Efficient with asynchronous communication.
  - Strive for clear communication using emphasis, lists, links, and emojis.
  - Communicate the necessary response and its urgency.
- Video Communication
  - Applicable when it is difficult to verbalize or when face-to-face discussion is desired.
  - Switch to video when text interaction is repeated.
  - Use collaborative editing notes and express gratitude.

In communication, I value **creating a relaxed atmosphere** and am someone who wants to incorporate icebreakers and humor. I also hope for a flat relationship where we can discuss things.

### Hobbies and Interests

One of my hobbies is personal development. Using technologies and tools that interest me, I am always pursuing new learning. Not only front-end technologies, but I have also expanded to libraries and tools related to DevOps, and various SaaS. Among them, I **never fail to output what I have learned**. I feel this is important for organizing my thoughts, contributing to the community, and as part of my self-growth.

Also, I love hot springs and walks. I am aware that I have a calm personality, and hot springs and walks not only refresh my mind and body but also serve as a good opportunity to organize my thoughts.

For a lighter topic, my favorite cream puff from Beard Papa is the **"Pie Croissant"**. And my favorite at Mister Donut is the **"Angel French"**.

### Income and Benefits

Regarding income, I would like to have at least the same or more than my previous job, if possible. As for benefits, I am looking for a company that has a comprehensive system of child care leave, nursing care leave, and reduced working hours. This is because there is a possibility that I will have responsibilities for family care and child rearing in the future.

### Work Style

I can work based in the Kansai region.
Full remote work or remote work with once-a-week office attendance is also possible.

### Others

Considering my past health issues, I want to have a **"margin" in my work style**.
Rather than constantly pursuing 100% performance, I want to maintain a temporal and mental "margin" towards my work.
This is not because I want to slack off, but because I understand that mental and physical health is essential for stable work in the medium to long term.
