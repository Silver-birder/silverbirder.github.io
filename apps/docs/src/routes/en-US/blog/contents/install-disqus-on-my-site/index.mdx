Until now, I had installed [Giscus](https://giscus.app/ja) as a comment service on my blog site.
Today, I switched to the same comment service, [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

In the case of Giscus, a GitHub account was required, but with Disqus, it is possible with accounts like Google and X.
With this, even non-engineers can comment! Hello!
