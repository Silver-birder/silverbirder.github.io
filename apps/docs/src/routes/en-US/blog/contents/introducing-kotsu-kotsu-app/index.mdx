## Introduction

I created a web app called [Kotsu-Kotsu](https://kotsu-kotsu.vercel.app) that allows you to consistently record and visualize anything!

## Why I Created It

While there are specialized recording apps for things like household budgets and strength training, I wanted to record more niche items. For example:

- **Days I took medication and the name of the tablet**

I occasionally take antihistamines and want to reduce the frequency, so I wanted to record how often I take them. I also sometimes want to record my coffee intake (ml) for similar reasons.

- **Days I changed my contact lenses**

I use two-week contact lenses, but sometimes I end up throwing them out after just one week because I usually change them on weekends. I felt it was wasteful and wanted to keep track to improve this habit.

- **Number of times I wake up at night**

I frequently wake up in the middle of the night. To get a better night's sleep, I wanted to analyze what might be affecting my sleep, so I decided to record whether I woke up or not.

If there were an app to record these things, I would use it, but since there wasn't, I decided to create one.

## How to Use Kotsu-Kotsu

Using "Kotsu-Kotsu" is simple.

1. Create a "Notebook" where you can freely define the format for recording.
2. Create "Pages" to register data in the defined format.
3. Display graphs based on the pages registered in the notebook.

You can choose from the following types of items for the recording format:

- Text
- Number
- Yes/No
- Category

Here are examples of a notebook and a page.

## Visualization Examples

When you log in for the first time, sample data is registered. Using this data, the following graphs are displayed.

## Features Not Yet Implemented

The following features have not been implemented yet. If there are any requests, I will implement them.

- Data import/export
- Visualization graph sharing

## Conclusion

I love consistently recording data and visualizing it for review. This app is perfect for me. If you're interested, please give it a try.
