## Introduction

I have been a long-time user of iPods and iPhones (starting from iPhone 4) since my student days, but I have finally switched to Google Pixel 8a. In this article, I will discuss the reasons and my impressions.

## Reasons for Switching from iPhone to Google Pixel

I was considering upgrading from my current iPhone XS to a new device, but I found the new iPhone 15 to be less appealing. While I heard about improvements in camera, storage, and battery, I honestly felt that these features were not necessary for me.

## The Appeal of Google Pixel 8a

In contrast, the Google Pixel 8a has many attractive features. Here are the ones I particularly like:

- **Call Screening and Hold for Me**:
  - Google Assistant can handle calls for you
  - Hold for Me feature
  - Quick unknown number search
- **Various Authentication Features**:
  - Both facial recognition and fingerprint authentication
- **"What’s this song?" Feature**:
  - Identifies the name of the song playing
- **Google Lens**:
  - Search for what the camera sees
  - Encircle items on your smartphone screen to search
- **Recorder**:
  - Automatic transcription of recordings
  - Labeling and searching of recordings

I haven't used camera features like Magic Eraser much because I don't do a lot of detailed work with the camera.

## Relationship with Google Services

Another reason I chose the Google Pixel 8a is the close integration with Google's services in my household.

I have a Google One Premium 2TB plan, so I manage all my photos with Google Photos. I also store my personal documents and books on Google Drive, and the text search within images is incredibly useful. Google's powerful search capabilities are invaluable in daily life.

I also frequently use Google Maps, having posted 489 reviews on it.

Moreover, my home is equipped with the following Google devices:

- Chromecast
- Google Nest Hub
- Google Nest Mini
- Google Nest Cam
- Google Nest Wifi

Collecting these devices has been enjoyable, and they have accumulated over time. However, I still use an iPad for my tablet needs.

## Differences in User Experience

I was worried about the user experience when switching from iPhone to Android. I had used Android for work occasionally but never felt comfortable with it. However, the Google Pixel's user experience is very similar to that of the iPhone. There was no discomfort in launching or closing apps, or using widgets on the home screen.

## Usability Differences

However, there are some inconveniences:

- **Connecting AirPods**:
  - AirPods automatically connected when placed in my ears with the iPhone, but this doesn’t work with the Google Pixel.
- **Using Apple Watch**:
  - Google Pixel cannot connect with the Apple Watch.
- **Integration with Mac**:
  - With the iPhone and Mac combination, I received call notifications on my Mac, but this doesn't work with the Google Pixel.

## Conclusion

I used to be amazed by the evolution of the iPhone. I was impressed by the sleek and beautiful design of the iPod and features like the touch screen, Siri, fingerprint authentication, and Retina display. However, recently, the trend of making screens larger and improving cameras and batteries has left me less interested.
