The story of a [47-year-old who is retiring in 100 days](https://twitter.com/i/events/1418432177168031749) is a hot topic on Twitter.
While those posts were ongoing, I was job hunting.
I would like to briefly summarize the content of that activity and my impressions.

# Self-introduction

I am a web engineer in my 20s living in Kansai.
I had been vaguely considering changing jobs since around 2020, and for certain reasons, I was actively job hunting from the end of August to the end of October 2021.

# Job hunting

I used a scout-style job hunting site and had casual interviews.

I used the following two job hunting sites:

- [Bizreach](https://www.bizreach.jp/)
- [Findy](https://findy-code.io/)

Both are job hunting sites where companies scout job seekers.

Job seekers register their resumes and job change conditions on the job hunting site in advance.
Initially, I was looking for a new job on Bizreach (which I often saw in commercials), but I gave up using it for the following reasons:

- I can't link my achievements to the information I want to register
  - [Github](https://github.com/silverbirder)
  - [Portfolio](https://silverbirder.github.io)
  - [Resume](https://silverbirder.github.io/resume/)
    - PDF as needed

So, I switched to a service called Findy, which allows integration with Github.

In the end, I had casual interviews with one company on Bizreach and nine companies on Findy.

※ By the way, there were also people who contacted me via DM on SNS, but I ignored them because they seemed suspicious.

# How to proceed with Findy

I proceeded to the casual interview in the following flow.

1. The person in charge on the company side sends a "like" to the job seeker.
2. The "like" is notified to the job seeker (email, Line).
3. The job seeker checks the job details ([example](https://findy-code.io/companies/685/jobs/oBsGg3cfPWoiY)).
4. The job seeker sends a "maybe good" to the company.
5. The person in charge on the company side and the job seeker exchange messages.
6. The person in charge on the company side sets up a casual interview.

On Findy, you may receive a "like" from companies listed in the [list of posting companies](https://findy-code.io/companies).

> We carefully select and post recommended tech companies such as workplaces where engineers and programmers can try the latest technologies, white companies, major Japanese companies, foreign companies, and rapidly growing venture companies. Once you register, you will receive offers based on your skill deviation value from these companies.

I received "likes" from companies such as Mercari, Cybozu, and Hey (famous for its CM with Anjash Kojima).

# How to proceed with casual interviews

In this world, remote casual interviews have become the norm.
Therefore, after work on weekdays (after 18:00), you will have a casual interview using Zoom or Teams.

The flow of a casual interview is as follows:

1. Self-introduction
1. Company introduction using a recruitment pitch (ask questions as appropriate)
   1. Business talk (product, service)
   1. Company talk (mission, vision, value, culture)
   1. Field talk (development, technology, system)
1. Next action (MTG with other members, proceed with selection, hold)

The people who came for the casual interviews were often composed of the following:

- Group leader class people
- HR personnel
- Group leader class people + HR personnel

There was a time when I had a casual interview with the CTO, but I was so nervous that the information exchange became one-way (CTO → me)...

# Thoughts on Casual Interviews

## Motivation changes with the content of the message before the casual interview

Before proceeding with the casual interview, I receive a message from the person in charge on the company side (which I appreciate).
In that message, there are times when they write their impressions of Github and my portfolio.
Such messages make me feel like they are looking at me, and I often strongly express my intention to participate in the casual interview.

## Basic communication is important for smooth information exchange

First of all, I thought the following things should definitely be avoided:

- Can't hear what's being said
  - Speaking too fast
  - Voice is hard to hear / too quiet
- Can't read the other person's facial expressions
  - Not showing face (on Zoom or Teams)
  - Expression is dark / not smiling

The first point is that information exchange is not taking place, so it should definitely be avoided.
The second point is that I would prefer it to be avoided, but when having a conversation, I want to talk to someone who is cheerful, even if it's a sales smile.

## The participants in the casual interview should be people who are close to job seekers

I thought it would be good if the people who come to the casual interview are in positions where they might work with job seekers.
For example, in my case, I thought it would be good if the leader of a group or team came.
Having a casual interview with such a person makes it easier to understand the workplace and the perception of challenges.

## Avoided companies that became fully remote due to the Corona disaster

During the casual interview, I heard from many companies that they had become fully remote.
Living in Kansai, I was happy to have more opportunities to work for companies in Kanto, but I was worried that full remote work might disappear after the Corona disaster.
Therefore, I decided to avoid such companies.

## If you're unsure about a job, suggest an open position

When I'm not sure if the job content is appropriate for me, I decided to suggest a selection called "open position".
In my case, I often apply for web front-end jobs, but there are times when I'm unsure about other jobs.
In such cases, I suggested that they consider me for an "open position".
I want the company to think about which job frame would best utilize my strengths.

# In conclusion

This was my first time doing job hunting activities.
As I proceeded with my job hunting, I was made to think about various things, and I thought it was a good opportunity.

- What to consider when choosing a company
  - Sympathy for the business is a prerequisite
  - Salary, work style, technology, etc.
- What kind of person am I
  - Strengths and weaknesses
  - Experience and personality
  - What I can't do, what I can do, what I want to do
- What kind of career do I want to build
  - What kind of person do I want to be in a few years
  - How to set milestones

It's a good opportunity, but job hunting makes you feel worn out, so I didn't want to do it again...
