Are you using Zoom?
I have released a GAS library that automatically generates Zoom meetings,
and I would like to introduce the background and how to use it.

# Background

I learned about the following Qiita article on my company's Slack.

https://qiita.com/kudota/items/b480610cc3f575a8ec6f

While thinking that it's easy to create a Zoom meeting from GAS,
I saw a comment on Slack saying "I want to use it like cron", so I decided to create it in a day.

There must be companies that regularly update Zoom meetings (ID and password).
For such companies, this tool may be useful.

# What I created

https://github.com/silverbirder/zoom-meeting-creator

You can use it by adding this library on the GAS side.
With this GAS, you can:

- Create a Zoom meeting
- Integrate with Slack

By combining these features with the regular execution of GAS, you can "use the creation of Zoom meetings like cron".
