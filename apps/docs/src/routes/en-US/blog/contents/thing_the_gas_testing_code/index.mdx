I have published a library in Google Apps Script (hereafter, GAS). When developing the library, I chose a tech stack of `Clasp + Typescript + Jest` to **shorten the test feedback cycle**. I would like to share my development experience. I haven't done anything particularly unusual.

# How do you test Google Apps Script?

Isn't it hard to debug by accessing [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/)?

- It's **slow** because you're stepping over the network
- It's **troublesome** to adjust the service side (like preparing data) when integrating with G Suite services
- The debug function is **poor**

It's very **stressful**. It's fine for a simple GAS, but if you want to create a slightly complex GAS, you'll feel it's a problem.

# Let's run it locally

Google has released a command-line tool called Clasp that allows you to run GAS in a local environment.

https://github.com/google/clasp

Also, since Clasp supports Typescript, it is now possible to code focusing on types.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/google-apps-script

Choosing Typescript makes interface design easier. Of course, I think the same can be achieved with `.gs` files.

Next, by combining with a testing tool called Jest, testing is possible in a local environment.

https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started

However, you can't just write test code.
For example, when coding a test to get a calendar event, suppose you write the following script.

```typescript
const calendar: Calendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(
  "<your google calendar id>"
);
calendar
  .getEvents(new Date("2020-01-01"), new Date("2020-01-02"))
  .forEach((calendarEvent: CalendarEvent) => {
    console.log(calendarEvent.getTitle());
  });
```

If you write it like this, it will actually go to get the real calendar event. In a test, you would want to avoid such processing.
Therefore, to replace `CalendarApp` with a fake object, or a Mock object, we apply the principle of dependency inversion.

```typescript
interface ICalendarApp {
  calendars?: Array<ICalendar>;
  getCalendarById(id: string): ICalendar;
}

interface ICalendar {
  calendarEvents?: Array<ICalendarEvent>;
  getEvents(startTime: Date, endTime: Date): Array<ICalendarEvent>;
}

interface ICalendarEvent {
  title?: string;
  getTitle(): string;
}

class CalendarAppMock implements ICalendarApp {
  calendars?: Array<ICalendar>;

  getCalendarById(id: string): ICalendar {
    return this.calendars![0].calendar;
  }
}

class CalendarAppImpl implements ICalendarApp {
  getCalendarById(id: string): ICalendar {
    const calendar: ICalendar = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(id);
    return calendar;
  }
}
```

Prepare such an interface/class and modify the previous code as follows.

```typescript
const calendar: ICalendar = new CalendarAppMock().getCalendarById();
calendar
  .getEvents(new Date("2020-01-01"), new Date("2020-01-02"))
  .forEach((calendarEvent: ICalendarEvent) => {
    console.log(calendarEvent.getTitle());
  });
```

As a result, you can now insert a Mock object instead of `CalendarApp`. This makes local testing possible.

Of course, in product code, you should use `CalendarAppImpl` instead of `CalendarAppMock`.
If the number of objects to be replaced with Mock increases, you might want to consider a DI container like InversifyJS.

By doing this, tests by Jest will work.  
In fact, I was able to fully test the library I developed and published.

The test of the function provided as a library is finished in just **about 3 seconds**.
I was able to develop locally **stress-free**.

For more details, please see the source code of the library I actually created ([\_\_tests\_\_](https://github.com/silverbirder/CaAT/tree/master/__tests__)).

# Conclusion

GAS is very convenient. It improves productivity.
You can quickly build APIs, and integration with G Suite is (of course) easy.

However, if the code becomes low in maintainability, **it will become obsolete and no one will be able to take care of it**.
Test code is **essential** to always stay clean.
Those who operate GAS, please consider test code.

# Eh, wait a minute. Introduction of the library!

This is a library that I would like teams who are doing agile development and managing schedules with Google Calendar to use.

https://github.com/silverbirder/caat

> CaAT is the Google Apps Script Library that Calculate the Assigned Time in Google Calendar.

What you can do with this tool is as follows.

- Get the time (minutes) scheduled in a specific user's Google Calendar for a specified period
- Overlapping appointments are considered as continuous appointments
- Specified time/words are considered as non-calculable (such as lunch)
- Who is taking a day off and when, get from all-day events

There is actually sample code, so please refer to it.
