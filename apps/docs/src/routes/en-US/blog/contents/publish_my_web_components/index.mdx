I have created the following two Web Components.

## Background

I wanted to display embedded content on my blog.
I was using a service called iframely, but I was motivated to create my own.
So, I created my own Web Components that can display OEmbed and OGP.

## In conclusion

My blog uses Rocket, an SSG that seamlessly uses Markdown and Web Components.
Therefore, I was able to easily incorporate the Web Components I published myself.
Ah, I'm satisfied.
