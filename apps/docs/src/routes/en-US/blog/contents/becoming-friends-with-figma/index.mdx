So far, I have been implementing the web frontend while referring to the wonderful Figma artifacts created by designers. As I experienced this over and over, I wanted to become proficient in using Figma.

## Dependence on CSS Frameworks

In my personal development so far, I have been developing web applications with a neat appearance using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Material UI. I often felt that the "Bootstrap-like" was too strong. However, I didn't know how to improve the look of the web with originality. From a few years ago, Tailwind CSS became a trend, and I wanted to aim for more free styling. Furthermore, I have been doing more work to convert designs using Figma into React code in my work, and I have been doing more styling myself. That's why I wanted to use Figma myself.

## Formulating Concepts

Instead of starting Figma suddenly, I first roughly thought about the purpose, target, and problems to be solved of the web application I wanted to draw. I thought about these using the food price comparison service "bochi bochi" that I am developing personally as an example.

## Referencing Design Systems

Once the concept was somewhat solidified, I referred to the design system of the Digital Agency. From basic styles such as typography, color, and spacing, to components such as buttons and text fields, I refer to what seems to be useful.

## Learning How to Use Figma

When I started the project in Figma, I initially focused on the design for smartphones without considering the responsive design for PCs and tablets. I initially struggled with the operation of Figma, but my understanding of the functions gradually deepened by using it repeatedly. In particular, I felt the convenience of defining and reusing styles and components. Among them, the Auto Layout function is exceptional, and I use it frequently because of its ease of use.

## Actually Designing

I actually did the design work and felt a big change before and after the design. When I used Figma before, I was just stacking basic shapes or sketching roughly by hand. However, now I feel that I can create a more structured, proper design.

Below is the appearance of [bochi bochi](https://bochi-bochi.vercel.app/) implemented without using Figma.

  width={824 / 3}
  height={1396 / 3}
  layout="constrained"
  alt="Before bochi bochi"
/>

And here is the new design of [bochi bochi](https://bochi-bochi.vercel.app/) that I worked on using Figma in the past few days.

  width={816 / 3}
  height={1488 / 3}
  layout="constrained"
  alt="After bochi bochi"
/>

It's hard to say which is superior, but personally, I'm satisfied with the new design.

## Conclusion

From now on, I plan to implement the designs created in Figma into React code and apply them to the already operational [bochi bochi](https://bochi-bochi.vercel.app/).
Meeting Figma has added a new step to my development skills.
