About [Playwright Component Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components) ("playwright-ct"), which allows you to run component tests in the browser directly on Playwright I learned about it and tried it out.
In this article, we share our experience. The repository we actually used is as follows

https://github.com/silverbirder/react-todoMVC-2

## Preparation

playwright-ct supports multiple frameworks such as React.
In this case, we used Next.js to build the application because `create-react-app` is deprecated.
We incorporated [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) as an example.

The playwright-ct setup is done with `npm init playwright@latest -- --ct` and several files are generated.
Of the generated files, I added the following code to `playwright-ct.config.ts`.
This is to reflect the paths setting in tsconfig of Next.js in playwright-ct as well.

```ts
// playwright-ct.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  ...
  use: {
    ...
    ctViteConfig: {
      resolve: {
        alias: {
          '#': resolve(__dirname, './'),
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

We also added the following code to the file `playwright/index.tsx` to apply the todoMVC style.

```tsx
// playwright/index.tsx
import "todomvc-app-css/index.css";.
```

The way playwright-ct works is that it **compiles the code, serves it on a local web server, loads it into playwright/index.html, draws it, and tests it** .

## Example test code

The code for the Todo list component looks like this

```tsx
// todo-list.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Todo } from "./types";

const TodoList = ({ todos, toggleTodo, deleteTodo }) => (
  <ul className="todo-list">
    {todos.map((todo) => (
      <li key={todo.id} className={todo.completed ? "completed" : ""}>
        <div className="view">
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            className="toggle"
            checked={todo.completed}
            onChange={() => toggleTodo(todo.id)}
          />
          <label>{todo.text}</label>
          <button className="destroy" onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}></button>
        </div>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);

export default TodoList;
```

The test case is written as follows.

```tsx
// test case
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/experimental-ct-react";
import TodoList from "./todo-list";

test.use({ viewport: { width: 500, height: 500 } });

test("todo display differently in completed state", async ({ mount, page }) => {
  await mount(
    <TodoList
      todos={[
        { id: 1, text: "My Todo 1", completed: true },
        { id: 2, text: "My Todo 2", completed: false },
      ]}
      toggleTodo={() => {}}
      deleteTodo={() => {}}
    />
  );
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot();
});
```

The beauty of playwright-ct is that you can test in a **real browser environment**, handling viewports, window objects, and WebAPI's. You can also test cross-browser (chromium, firefox, webkit).

Tests can be run with `playwright test -c playwright-ct.config.ts`.

Next is the code for the Next.js page component. (Not React Server Components)

```tsx
// page.tsx
"use client";

import TodoList from "@/ui/todo-list";
import { Todo } from "@/ui/types";
import { useState, type KeyboardEvent } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  const addTodo = () => {
    if (!text) return;
    const newTodo: Todo = { id: Date.now(), text, completed: false };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
    setText("");
    const params = new URLSearchParams("");
    params.set("added", "true");
    window.history.pushState(null, "", `?${params.toString()}`);
  };

  const toggleTodo = (id: number) => {
    setTodos(
      todos.map((todo) => {
        if (todo.id === id) {
          return { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed };
        }
        return todo;
      })
    );
  };

  const deleteTodo = (id: number) => {
    setTodos(todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== id));
  };

  const handleKeydown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key !== "Enter") {
      return;
    }
    addTodo();
  };

  return (
    <section className="todoapp">
      <header className="header">
        <h1>todos</h1>
        <input
          className="new-todo"
          value={text}
          onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
          onKeyDown={(e) => handleKeydown(e)}
          placeholder="What needs to be done?"
          autoFocus
        />
      </header>
      <main className="main">
        <TodoList
          todos={todos}
          toggleTodo={toggleTodo}
          deleteTodo={deleteTodo}
        />
      </main>
    </section>
  );
}
```

The `addTodo` function dares to use `window.history`.
In order to use a function like useRouter in Next.js, some preparation is required.
In traditional testing, it is common to mock (imitate) the parts related to such a window object.
With playwright-ct, however, it is possible to test using these real browser functions.

An example test code for a page component is shown below.

```tsx
// page.test.tsx
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/experimental-ct-react";
import App from "./page";

test.use({ viewport: { width: 500, height: 500 } });

test("todos text should be displayed", async ({ mount }) => {
  // Act
  const component = await mount(<App />);

  // Assert
  await expect(component).toContainText("todos");
});

test("adding todo will add the added query parameter to the URL", async ({
  mount,
  page,
}) => {
  // Arrange
  const component = await mount(<App />);
  await component.getByRole("textbox").fill("My Todo 1");

  // Act
  await page.keyboard.press("Enter");

  // Assert
  expect(page).toHaveURL(/added/);
});
```

With playwright-ct, it is possible to operate not only on components, but also directly on Playwright's page object.
This greatly expands the testing variation and allows for more multifaceted test scenarios to be executed.

## Summary

playwright-ct enables testing in a way that more closely resembles the actual browser environment and plays the role of a coupled test.
Playwright does not have the mocking capabilities of Jest, making it difficult to verify that, for example, the handler functions in `todo-list.tsx` were executed correctly.
Detailed verification at the unit test level still requires a tool like Jest, but for testing the components that make up a screen, playwright-ct would be very useful.
We intend to continue to actively utilize such tools to develop quality web applications.
