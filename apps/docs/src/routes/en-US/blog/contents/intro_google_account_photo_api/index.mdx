How do you manage your profile picture? For example, do you update your Zenn profile picture? I often neglect to update my profile picture because it's a hassle. (It would be nice if we could use a SaaS like Gravatar...)

Recently, I was considering refreshing my [portfolio page](https://silverbirder.github.io/), and I was wondering what to do with my profile picture. The base document of the portfolio is written in Markdown.

I thought about setting the profile picture via an API instead of keeping it fixed, so I created the **Google Account Photo API**, which only returns Google account images.

The source code for the API is [here(Github)](https://github.com/silverbirder/Google-Account-Photo-API). I made it in about an hour, so I only looked at the normal pattern. (laughs) Please understand.

# Which is the Google Account Image?

The Google account image is the image in the upper right corner displayed on [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) (only for those who are logged in).

# How to Use the API

To call the API, you need to prepare something called your Google account ID.

## How to Find Your Google Account ID

You can find your Google account ID by running the [Google People API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/people/api/rest/v1/people/get?apix_params=%7B%22resourceName%22%3A%22people%2Fme%22%2C%22personFields%22%3A%22photos%22%7D).

When you run it, a field called `resourceName(ex. people/<account_id>)` is returned, and the account_id written there is yours.

## Calling the API

The API is called by a GET request to the following URL. YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID is the account_id you obtained earlier.

```
https://google-account-photo.vercel.app/api/?account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```

When you call it, an image is returned. In my case, the following image is returned.

![my google account image](https://google-account-photo.vercel.app/api/?account_id=101722346324226588907)

## Utilizing it in Markdown

With this API, you can display a profile picture just by writing the following Markdown!

```
![google account image](https://google-account-photo.vercel.app/api/?account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID)
```

Just this might be a bit bland, so let's use Cloudinary. Cloudinary allows you to process images just by setting URL parameters. For example, if you want to make the image a circle, you would write the following URL.

```
![circle google account image](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/fetch/r_max/https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle-account-photo.vercel.app%2Fapi%2F%3Faccount_id%3DYOUR_ACCOUNT_ID)
```

I will omit the explanation about Cloudinary.

In my case, the following image will be displayed.

![my_google_account_image_circle](https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/fetch/r_max/https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle-account-photo.vercel.app%2Fapi%2F%3Faccount_id%3D101722346324226588907)

# In Conclusion

I thought it's a convenient world where you can quickly build an API.
