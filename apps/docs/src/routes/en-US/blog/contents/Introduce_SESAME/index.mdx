Say goodbye to the worry of "Where did I put my key?"

# What is SESAME?

https://jp.candyhouse.co/

> What do you take with you when you leave the house?
> Keys, wallet, and smartphone...?
> You don't need a key anymore.
> Your smartphone will be your key.

You can unlock the key on your home door from your smartphone.

# Q. Isn't it dangerous?

On the official page, it is announced as follows.

In conclusion, it seems to be well considered, so you may not need to be too nervous.

## Long battery life

> The battery lasts about 500 days. You can rest assured because you will be notified on your smartphone when the remaining battery is low.

## Conventional keys can also be used

> SESAME can also be used with conventional keys as before. You can rest assured even if you are not used to smartphones or if your smartphone battery runs out.

## Notification function

> When someone opens or closes the door, it will notify your smartphone.

## Security is at the level of a certain country's military

> SESAME does not attract bad people. SESAME adopts AES-256-GCM and TLS 1.2.

# Q. What features does it have?

- Auto unlock & lock
  - When SEMAME and your smartphone get close or move away from a certain distance, the key will open and close.
- Knock function (only supported on iOS)
  - If you knock on your smartphone while the app is running in the background, SEMAME will unlock for you.
- Key sharing
  - You can share the key with specific people.

# The process until I tried it

First of all, the door of my house is like the following image. I was thinking of attaching SESAME to the key below here.

However, when I tried it, SESAME could not be installed on the door of my house...

The problem is that SESAME is attached with double-sided tape, so it needs to be attached to a wall. However, there is a step on the door of my house, so I couldn't attach SESAME...

So, when I contacted customer support, they kindly followed up and made an adapter for me. (Free shipping, but you have to write an Amazon review)

The response was incredibly fast, and I was truly impressed.
The information I provided was about the necessary lengths of each door.

After providing each length, I was informed that the following adapter was completed. (I guess it was created with a 3D printer)

When I tried to set this on the door of my house, it fit perfectly, and I was able to stick the double-sided tape successfully! Snap snap!

At first, I thought a white adapter would come, but a black one came. Nice!

I tried using SESAME from the front door of my house. If Bluetooth is connected, you can unlock smoothly! Yay!

# Disappointing points...

You can only unlock the key **for the first time** when SESAME and your smartphone are connected to Bluetooth. So, you can't do anything until you're connected to Bluetooth.

Waiting for that takes a long time, several tens of seconds, so you have to wait a bit. Also, the auto-lock is activated when you are about 10 steps away, but the auto-unlock hardly worked (the key is unlocked when you approach). The knock function is the same, and the knock is only effective when connected to Bluetooth. Moreover, even when connected to Bluetooth, the knock failure rate is high, and it's not very useful... There is room for improvement.

# Summary

I had a good impression of the customer support follow-up, about 5 stars on Amazon reviews. As for the functions, as I mentioned in the disappointing points, the main feature was a bit disappointing. However, the original purpose of "the trouble of looking for keys" has been eliminated. If you launch the app when you approach the door of your house, the Bluetooth connection will go smoothly, and you can open the key with one tap. In other words, if you devise how to use it, I personally think that the merits are much greater.

By all means, please consider purchasing it. The main unit is currently 14,800 yen for one! It's much cheaper than replacing the door!

â€» By the way, I purchased only the main unit without a WiFi access point.
