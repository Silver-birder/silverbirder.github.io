I have refreshed my portfolio page. In this article,
I would like to introduce the motivation for the refresh, the content of the refresh, and the future.

# Motivation

Originally, my portfolio page was built using Hugo, a static page generator.

http://kohki.hatenablog.jp/entry/hugo-portfolio

I referred to this article and created a portfolio page with Hugo.
At that time, I think I had the following three thoughts about why I created a portfolio.

- I want people to know what kind of person I am
- I want to have my own site
- I want to try using a static page generator

Managing articles with Hugo is easy for engineers because it's done in Markdown.
Also, there are publicly available design themes, so you can choose the one you like.

At first, it was very comfortable. I was satisfied with being able to easily publish a stylish portfolio site.
However, as I continued to use it, I began to feel frustrated that I couldn't reach the parts that were itching.
I think this is a trade-off with convenience, but I began to recognize the following disadvantages.

- Technical challenges with Javascript are difficult
- Customizing the design theme is difficult
- SEO tuning is difficult

I began to think that the disadvantages outweighed the advantages of convenience.
Therefore, I decided to create a portfolio site on my own.

# What I did

I created a portfolio site that makes full use of AMP. The overall picture is as follows.

  width={532}
  height={361}
  layout="constrained"
  alt="overview"
/>

The structure is centered around [AMP Optimizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer).
The source code is in the following repository.

https://github.com/silverbirder/silverbirder.github.io

# Technology selection

For this portfolio site, I decided against using a web framework (e.g. Next.js) with more features than necessary, as it would increase maintenance costs.
Also, I decided against a static page generator (e.g. Gatsby) for the reasons mentioned in the motivation section.
Therefore, I aimed for a minimal necessary configuration. As a result, the flow became as follows.

1. Prepare the content (Markdown, HTML, JSON)
2. AMP-ify 1 as input with [AMP Optimizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer)

I adopted [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) as a task runner to control these orders.
[AMP Optimizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ampproject/toolbox-optimizer) is installed via NPM, so I looked for a task runner that works well with Node.js.
The options were Grunt and Gulp, but since [Gulp was introduced on the official AMP site](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/amp-optimizer-guide/node-amp-optimizer/), I chose Gulp.

Here are the major technical choices. Other minor details are as follows:

- highlightjs
  - Program code highlighting feature
- jsdom
  - Various html processing
    - Setting of h1~h6 tag Anchors (like anchorJS)
    - Mix of HTML template and main content
    - ...etc
- ampcssframework
  - Wanted Dark Theme and Grid functionality
- Cloudinary
  - Image management SaaS. Used for OGP, etc.
- For SEO
  - Google search console
  - Google analytics

# Portfolio Content

I was wondering what kind of content to prepare for the portfolio site.
There is a [Markdown option in AMP Optimizer](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-toolbox/tree/main/packages/optimizer#markdown).
It seems that not only HTML but also Markdown can be converted to AMP (via HTML).
Therefore, I realized that I could add blog-like content to the portfolio page.
Also, the blog content I have written so far was managed in Markdown, so it seemed to be just usable.

As a result, I prepared the following content:

- Self-introduction
- Blog
- Book search
- Purchased item list
  - Things bought on Amazon, subscriptions
- Watch
  - RSS I'm checking
- Projects
  - Introduction of what I made

I tried to add a WebPush function for RSS on the watch page, but it required a server to push, and the development seemed to be prolonged, so I gave up.

# How was it after the renewal?

As expected, I was able to extend various portfolio site functions that could not be done with Hugo.

- Technical challenges with Javascript are difficult
  - I was able to try AMP and Web Worker (amp-script)
- Customizing design themes is difficult
  - I was able to do CSS framework and CSS tuning
- SEO tuning is difficult
  - I was able to use SearchConsole and GoogleAnalytics
  - I was able to tune sitemap and meta tags

What I couldn't do as expected was the constraint of AMP, but there were technologies that couldn't be moved on amp-script like WebComponents.
Also, I tried to import ES Module ([skypack](https://skypack.dev/)) on WebWorker (amp-script), but Safari was not supported, so I gave up.

However, my final impression is that I was able to process HTML flexibly, so I think it was good to renew because I can do anything on AMP.

# What I learned

I will briefly look back from the experiential learning model. (for the first time)

| Experience                                       | Reflection                                                                                                                          | Conceptualization                                                                                       | Trial                                                  |

| Tried AMP for the first time                     | I had never used AMP before, but there were fewer issues than I thought.<br />However, there were also issues I hadn't anticipated. | The challenges of technical elements that have never been used are unknown even if they are anticipated | Try new technologies lightly                           |
| Did not use frameworks such as Next.js or Gatsby | I wanted a simple configuration.<br />I didn't want to put in a framework with more features than necessary.                        | To ensure maintainability, configure with minimal features                                              | Weigh maintainability when choosing major technologies |

# In Conclusion

I have refreshed my portfolio. Since I had never built a website from scratch before,
it was a good study for me to develop everything by hand, including sitemap and JSON-LD.
There are still many issues with my portfolio, but I would like to improve it little by little.
