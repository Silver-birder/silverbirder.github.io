There are times when you want to scrape data. I found the OSS Crawlee to be useful, so I'm sharing it.

## Background

When you want to scrape data, you might write a crawling program in your preferred language and scrape the HTML.
I'm good at Node.js, so I often write with fetch + jsdom. If browser rendering is necessary, I sometimes use a headless browser.
I find it a bit troublesome to set this up every time. That's when I found the OSS Crawlee to be useful.

## Crawlee

Quoted from https://crawlee.dev/.

> Crawlee is a web scraping and browser automation library.
> It helps you build reliable crawlers. Fast.
> Crawlee won't fix broken selectors for you (yet), but it helps you build and maintain your crawlers faster.

Crawlee can't fix broken selectors, but it can help you build crawlers quickly.

## Good Points of Crawlee

I will list the features of Crawlee that I found to be good.

### Crawlee has a template

Crawlee can generate code with `npx crawlee create`.

```bash
$ npx crawlee create my-crawler
? Please select the template for your new Crawlee project (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Getting started example [TypeScript]
  Getting started example [JavaScript]
  CheerioCrawler template project [TypeScript]
  PlaywrightCrawler template project [TypeScript]
  PuppeteerCrawler template project [TypeScript]
  CheerioCrawler template project [JavaScript]
  PlaywrightCrawler template project [JavaScript]
```

It supports TypeScript.
Also, by default, the Crawler adopts Cherrio, which is a plain HTTP crawler.
If necessary, you can use Playwright or Puppeteer, and switching Crawlers is easy because the interfaces are aligned.

### The RequestQueue Mechanism

In a crawler, it's common to access multiple URLs.
Requests are managed by a queue called RequestQueue, and the crawler automatically accesses them.
The queue manages unique URLs, so there is no duplicate access.

- https://crawlee.dev/api/core/class/RequestQueue

This mechanism can be implemented with the following simple code.

```javascript
import { RequestQueue } from "crawlee";
const requestQueue = await RequestQueue.open();
await requestQueue.addRequest({ url: "https://crawlee.dev" });
```

Furthermore, there is a feature called enqueueLinks. This adds the URL of the anchor on the page you are accessing to the RequestQueue.
The following code is an example of enqueueLinks.

```javascript
import { CheerioCrawler } from "crawlee";
const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
  async requestHandler({ enqueueLinks }) {
    await enqueueLinks();
  },
});
await crawler.run(["https://crawlee.dev"]);
```

enqueueLinks has various options.

- https://crawlee.dev/api/core/function/enqueueLinks

For example, you can filter links with globs, or specify the selector of the anchor.

### Data is Saved in JSON

The data obtained by scraping can be saved in json.

- https://crawlee.dev/docs/introduction/saving-data

For example, if you want to collect the requested URLs, the code would be like this.

```javascript
import { CheerioCrawler, Dataset } from "crawlee";

const crawler = new CheerioCrawler({
  async requestHandler({ request }) {
    await Dataset.pushData({ url: request.url });
  },
});
await crawler.run(["https://crawlee.dev"]);
```

The save destination will be `{PROJECT_FOLDER}/storage/datasets/default/`.
You can save data very easily.

## In conclusion

There is Apify as a SaaS of Crawlee. You might want to try it casually.
