# I tried to deploy

[https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy)

I will proceed with reference to this.

By the way, the operating environment is done inside the following container.

[https://hub.docker.com/r/google/cloud-sdk](https://hub.docker.com/r/google/cloud-sdk)

## step1. Various settings of gcloud

```shell
$ gcloud components update
$ gcloud components install beta
$ gcloud config set run/region us-central1
```

※ As of 2019/04/11, Cloud Run is beta.

## step2. Creating application code

```shell
$ mkdir helloworld-go && cd helloworld-go
$ touch helloworld.go Dockerfile
```

```go
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "log"
        "net/http"
        "os"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        log.Print("Hello world received a request.")
        target := os.Getenv("TARGET")
        if target == "" {
                target = "World"
        }
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello %s!\n", target)
}

func main() {
        log.Print("Hello world sample started.")

        http.HandleFunc("/", handler)

        port := os.Getenv("PORT")
        if port == "" {
                port = "8080"
        }

        log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%s", port), nil))
}
```

```Dockerfile
# Use the offical Golang image to create a build artifact.
# This is based on Debian and sets the GOPATH to /go.
# https://hub.docker.com/_/golang
FROM golang:1.12 as builder

# Copy local code to the container image.
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/knative/docs/helloworld
COPY . .

# Build the command inside the container.
# (You may fetch or manage dependencies here,
# either manually or with a tool like "godep".)
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -v -o helloworld

# Use a Docker multi-stage build to create a lean production image.
# https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/#use-multi-stage-builds
FROM alpine

# Copy the binary to the production image from the builder stage.
COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/knative/docs/helloworld/helloworld /helloworld

# Run the web service on container startup.
CMD ["/helloworld"]
```

## step3. Registration & Deployment

```shell
$ gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/helloworld
$ gcloud beta run deploy --image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/helloworld
```

# Impressions

I usually use a Serverless Deployments called [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now) when I'm doing personal development. This service used to support docker containers in v1, but it no longer does in v2. However, I felt this was the best service when choosing something that can be deployed easily for free.

However, I learned that CloudRun was released in Beta version at the GoogleCloudNext19 announcement, and I tried it out immediately.
I was able to proceed with the steps this time without any problems and deploy within 3 minutes.
I was impressed by how easy and convenient it was.
Also, looking at the [price table](https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing), it's a pay-as-you-go system like CloudFunctions, and it's free up to 2 million requests per month. For personal development, this is much more cost-effective than the instance startup time-based pricing of AppEngine.
I have no choice but to quit now.sh and switch to this one!!
