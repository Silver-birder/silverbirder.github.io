We are approaching the end of the year 2022. I am going to look back on this year.
This will be written for myself, so I will structure my writing and do it inappropriately.

## Work

In January this year, I started working at a new place. This is the second job change in my life.
I've become quite familiar with the procedures related to changing jobs for the second time.

At my new workplace, we communicate via Slack and Discord, which is a very lively and fun place to work, with a lot of blurting out comments. It's a comfortable environment because I can giggle and laugh.

I have experienced full-stack engineering skills, but I wanted to improve my front-end engineering skills again (I originally entered the IT industry as a web front-end engineer), so I changed jobs.

However, for about six months after joining the company, I was doing domain catch-up and back-end development.

Because it was a special domain, I had to study it and the back-end programming language was unfamiliar to me, so I had my hands full with a lot of things.

After six months, I was able to invest in front-end development and was able to try React and TypeScript for the first time in my work.

I finished a project to replace one screen with React, dutifully did front-end reviews for an awesome intern, took on a front-end revamp project, worked with people with long front-end careers for a few months, and was satisfied that I was absorbing right up to the minute with a bang! I'm happy to say that I'm absorbing a lot of new things.

I also inherently prefer reading about how browsers work and HTML and WebAPI specifications to frameworks such as React, so I'll continue to do that.

From November this year, I will be working with members of the Nagoya office and commuting by bullet train from Osaka, where I live. We have an edgy architecture there and I'm looking forward to it and throwing myself into it as hard as I can.

## Private life

I live with my wife. We both feel that it's time for us to have children. I want my grandparents and parents to see our child.

We had no idea about fertility.
I was very worried because it was very difficult to conceive naturally.
Someone at work told me about fertility treatment, and after discussing it with my wife and taking twists and turns, we were able to proceed to fertility treatment tests. Because my wife is busy as a childcare worker, she doesn't have much time to go for tests, so the tests have not yet been completed.

There were times when it was hard for me because of the mental strain on my wife as we proceeded with fertility treatment. Recently, I have started to think that 'having a child is a gift' and that it would be good if we could have a child, and I've come to separate it from luck."

## Money and time

Next April, I will be living in an empty house that belongs to my grandparents. The reason is that the empty house is near my parents' house and I feel safer being near them (because of my children).
The grandparents also wanted someone else to take the empty house because they didn't want them to be in a mess of inheritance before they passed away. We decided to take over the house because we wouldn't have to pay rent (we only have to pay property tax of about 20,000 to 30,000 a year).

This way, we will be able to reduce our expenditure a lot, and we have 10 million in savings after rounding up, so my wife will be free to go without working next April.

I will want as much money as I can get, but to be honest, for me, I always want to prioritise time with my family over money.

Therefore, I am wondering whether I should continue to work full-time, five days a week for eight hours a day, or whether I should do a contract job or even a small side job.

In terms of side jobs, I'm thinking about doing the programming teaching service I used to do again.

Or I like taking photos of people, and I think photos are a great way to preserve memories and give people a warm feeling when they look back on them someday, so I think it would be interesting to connect that with a small side job.

## Aspirations for next year

I'd like to spend more time with my family than with work.

Having said that, making things is fun after all, so I'll try to improve my skills at work, while still messing around within the scope of my hobbies.

## Looking back at the past

When I read the past look back, I felt kind of emo.

In the end, I decided not to buy a car. Living in an area with good transport links, I still felt there were significant disadvantages.
