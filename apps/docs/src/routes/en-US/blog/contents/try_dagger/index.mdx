I tried out Dagger, a tool for CI/CD that I've been curious about for a while, which is not vendor-locked.
In this article, I will share what I tried.

## Writing CI/CD Pipelines

In Dagger, you write CI/CD pipelines using a language called [CUE](https://cuelang.org/).
I will use it as it is from the [official site tutorial](https://docs.dagger.io/1200/local-dev).
The code will look like this.

```go
package todoapp

import (
	"dagger.io/dagger"

	"dagger.io/dagger/core"
	"universe.dagger.io/netlify"
	"universe.dagger.io/yarn"
)

dagger.#Plan & {
	actions: {
		source: core.#Source & {
			path: "."
			exclude: [
				"node_modules",
				"build",
				"*.cue",
				"*.md",
				".git",
			]
		}

		build: yarn.#Script & {
			name:   "build"
			source: actions.source.output
		}

		test: yarn.#Script & {
			name:   "test"
			source: actions.source.output
			container: env: CI: "true"
		}

		deploy: netlify.#Deploy & {
			contents: actions.build.output
			site:     string | *"dagger-todoapp"
		}
	}
}
```

It may be an unfamiliar syntax, but I think you can somewhat understand what it's doing.
Actions define what to execute, and you use them like `dagger do <action name>`.
The `source: core.#Source` in the above definition is `source` as the action name, and `core` as the package to execute.
Packages are classified into the following two.

- [dagger.io](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/v0.2.0/pkg/dagger.io)
  - Standard features
    - core
- [universe.dagger.io](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/v0.2.0/pkg/universe.dagger.io)
  - Non-standard features
    - yarn, netlify, aws, bash, etc

## Running Dagger in a Local Environment

Let's actually run it locally.

```bash
$ dagger do test
[✔] actions.test.container                                                                                                                11.6s
[✔] actions.test.install.container.script                                                                                                  0.1s
[✔] actions.source                                                                                                                         0.5s
[✔] actions.test.install.container                                                                                                         2.3s
[✔] actions.test.container.script                                                                                                          0.1s
[✔] actions.test.install.container.export                                                                                                  0.0s
[✔] actions.test.container.export                                                                                                          0.2s
Field  Value
logs   """\n  yarn run v1.22.17\n  $ react-scripts test\n  Done in 6.78s.\n\n  """
```

It passes without any problems. If you add `--log-format plain`, detailed execution information will be output.

```bash
$ dagger do test --log-format plain
8:06PM INFO  actions.test.install.container.script._write | computing
8:06PM INFO  actions.test.container._image._dag."0"._pull | computing
8:06PM INFO  actions.test.install.container._image._dag."0"._pull | computing
8:06PM INFO  actions.test.container.script._write | computing
8:06PM INFO  actions.source | computing
...
```

By the way, I think `actions.source` is executed because `actions.test` depends on `actions.source`.

```bash
$ NETLIFY_TOKEN=**** USER=**** dagger do deploy
[✔] actions.deploy.container.script                                                                                                        0.2s

```

I was able to run the CI/CD pipeline code in a local environment.
Next, I want to integrate it with CI.

## Running Dagger with CircleCI

First, let's run Dagger with CircleCI.
The CircleCI yml file will be defined as follows.

```yaml
# .circleci/config.yml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  install-and-run-dagger:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker:
          version: "20.10.14"
      - run:
          name: "Install Dagger"
          command: |
            cd /usr/local
            wget -O - https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | sudo sh
            cd -
      - run:
          name: "Update project"
          command: |
            dagger project init
            dagger project update
      - run:
          name: "Testing"
          command: |
            dagger do test --log-format plain
      - run:
          name: "Deploy to Netlify"
          command: |
            dagger do deploy --log-format plain

workflows:
  dagger-workflow:
    jobs:
      - install-and-run-dagger
```

Set `NETLIFY_TOKEN` and `USER` in the CircleCI environment variables.
This definition file just installs Dagger and runs `dagger do test` and `dagger do deploy` that we ran in the local environment earlier.

This definition passes on CircleCI. It's incredibly simple.

## Running Dagger with GithubActions

Next, let's run Dagger with GithubActions.
The GithubActions yml file will be defined as follows.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/todoapp.yml
name: todoapp

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  dagger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Clone repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Update project
        uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v3
        with:
          version: 0.2
          cmds: |
            project init
            project update
      - name: Testing
        uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v3
        with:
          version: 0.2
          cmds: |
            do test
      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v3
        with:
          version: 0.2
          cmds: |
            do deploy
        env:
          USER: ${{ secrets.USER }}
          NETLIFY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_TOKEN }}
```

I think this definition is almost the same as the CircleCI definition.
However, the slight difference is that GithubActions can use `uses: dagger/dagger-for-github@v3`, so `cmds` can be written as `do test` or `do deploy` without having to write `dagger`.

Set the `NETLIFY_TOKEN` and `USER` in the GithubActions environment variables.
Then, this pipeline will also succeed.

## In conclusion

We were able to test the CI/CD pipeline in a local environment and smoothly integrate it with the CI service.
This time, we used the tutorial as is, so the test and deployment were in a simple configuration,
but in actual work, I think the configuration will be more complex, so it's good to be able to check it on your own.
However, there is a learning cost for `CUE`, so consider that as well when introducing it.
