Hello, I’m silverbirder, a junior developer with 9 years of experience in the web industry.

Have you ever listened to a song on Spotify and thought, "**I’ve heard this song before, but what was it the theme song for?**" This often happens to me, especially when driving or working.  
One time, I became curious about a song I liked, and after realizing it was the theme song for an anime, I started watching the show. That was when I thought, "**It would be really convenient to have an app that can easily look up tie-up information (for anime, dramas, etc.).**" So, I decided to create this app.

Below is a screenshot and link to the web app I built.

In this article, I’ll explain the **technical aspects** of how this app works.

By the way, I often listen to **[Anime Now](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWT8aqnwgRt92)** on Spotify—perfect for testing tie-up information searches!

## Architecture Overview

This app quickly retrieves tie-up information for the song currently playing on Spotify and displays it to the user. Below is the architecture diagram.

Here are the technologies I used:

- **Spotify API**: Retrieve information about the currently playing track
- **Google Custom Search API**: Search for tie-up information via Google
- **OpenAI API**: Extract tie-up information from Google search results
- **Next.js**: Framework for the application
  - Design inspiration: [v0.dev/chat](https://v0.dev/chat)
- **Icon Generation**: [AI Icon Generator - perchance.org](https://perchance.org/ai-icon-generator)

## Development Process

### Retrieving Tie-up Information

At first, I looked for APIs that could provide tie-up information directly, but **none offered the kind of data I needed**. I considered services like RecoChoku, but they didn’t have the complete information I was looking for, so I gave up on that idea.

Next, I tried **using ChatGPT to retrieve tie-up information**. ChatGPT can return good results because it incorporates web search data. However, when using the **OpenAI API**, it doesn’t perform web searches, so it wasn’t enough to get the tie-up information I needed.

### Google Custom Search API + OpenAI API

So, I decided to use **Google Custom Search API** to retrieve web pages that likely contained the tie-up information. Then, I passed that information to the **OpenAI API** for analysis.  
**This combination allowed me to get highly accurate tie-up information.**

### Data Storage

Since using APIs involves **pay-per-use fees**, managing costs is essential. To reduce repeated searches, I store the **Google search results and OpenAI API data in a database**.

## Result: Enjoying Anime Theme Songs on Spotify

With this app, you can quickly find out **which anime or drama a song is the theme song for** while listening on Spotify. Especially with the **fall anime season** coming up, you can easily check related shows when you find a song you like—so I’m really looking forward to using it!

## Completed in Just a Week!

From the moment I came up with the idea to completion, it took only [a single week](https://x.com/silverbirder/status/1838179210403414103).  
**Turning an idea into a working product** was an incredibly fun experience.

If you’re interested, please try out the app!
