Hello, I'm [@silverbirder](https://x.com/silverbirder).
Recently, I've renewed my portfolio and blog pages using the Qwik framework.
This is the fourth time I've renewed my blog page. In this article, I will share the knowledge and experiences I gained in the process.

By the way, you can search for articles about previous renewals with the `Portfolio` tag.
I also use GitHub's release tags, so you can refer to the past source code from the link below.

Also, the source code is public, so feel free to refer to it.

## Why I refreshed

The main motivation for the refresh is curiosity.
Following that, it's also to broaden my technical knowledge.
In the past, I've tried static site generators like Hugo, AMP recommended by Google, and Rocket that can utilize WebComponents.
Each technology reflected the trends and interests of the time. This time too, I chose mainly based on current trends and technologies I'm interested in.

## Choosing the Qwik Framework

Qwik is a performance-focused framework, but that wasn't very important to me.
The main reasons I chose it are as follows:

- Markdown support
  - Because I use Markdown to write blogs
- High evaluation in `State of JS`
  - I thought it was worth learning because it was highly rated
- Syntax close to React
  - I wanted to reduce the learning cost

I had been entering tag information in the Frontmatter of the blog's Markdown, so I wanted to utilize that.
In the meantime, I found a repository called [doganozturk/blog-qwik - GitHub](https://github.com/doganozturk/blog-qwik).
From there, I learned about the `import.meta.glob` syntax (a Vite feature) and found a way to extract Frontmatter.
I started building the blog page based on this.

## What I implemented

The features I actually implemented in the blog are detailed in the README of [silverbirder/silverbirder.github.io - GitHub](https://github.com/silverbirder/silverbirder.github.io).
I will list the main features and introduced technologies below.

- **Playwright & Vitest** 🎭🔬
- **Qwik** ⚡🕸️

- **Google Analytics** 🕵️‍♂️📈
- **icones.js** 📌🌈
- **lottiefiles** 🎬📁
- **OpenAI** 🧠🌐
- **OpenReplay** 🎥🔄
- **OneSignal** 📡💌

Also, I extract the Frontmatter from Markdown and convert it to JSON, which I use to build blog pages. (The same applies to RSS feeds)

## What I Learned

Originally, I wanted to deepen my understanding of the concept of a framework called Qwik.
However, in the process of building a blog with Qwik, my interest shifted from the framework itself to related technologies and tools.
Rather than catching up with what I know, trying to learn such promising technologies provided a good opportunity to learn about unknown technologies.
Here are some things I learned.

### PandaCSS

I learned about a style engine called PandaCSS.
I've often used CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and materialUI.
However, from my recent experience developing landing pages at work, I wanted to try writing CSS.
So, I wanted to try writing CSS myself using PandaCSS.

I wrote global-css for the first time, and defined typography such as font-size and font-weight to reuse,
and also defined colors as semantic tokens with expressions like primary to reuse. (though not yet done)

There are many points I want to improve, but I thought it was good to be able to write such reusable CSS.
I thought it was convenient to be able to use CSS-in-JS notation and generate CSS files.

### Multilingual Support

I tried multilingual support for the first time. It's just a trial though.
When supporting multiple languages, I wondered what to do with the Japanese in the Markdown Japanese articles and components.

The main operation would be to have someone proficient in English translate the Japanese.
I thought it might be possible to use a localization SaaS that I researched.
However, I thought that at the individual level, there was no need to go that far.
So, I used two tools, qwik-speack and chatgpt-md-translator, for translation.
It seems to use OpenAI internally.

When supporting multiple languages, I became more careful about the content of WebPush notifications and link content.
I thought it would be good to have it from the beginning if it is actually used in business. (Even just the system would be good)

### Use of SaaS

This time, I tried using various SaaS.

#### OpenReplay

I introduced something called OpenReplay.
This is a tool to monitor user behavior.
In actual operation, I thought it could be used for troubleshooting and UX improvement.

I put this on the blog page, so I could see where the mouse is on which page, and it made me think about link placement and flow.

#### OneSignal

I also wanted to try push notifications.
However, I thought it was necessary to prepare the server side for push notifications, but I wanted to eliminate the cost of doing that,
so I tried using a well-known tool called OneSignal.

When sending notifications, the language selection and best practices for receiving notifications were written in OneSignal, which was educational.

#### Giscus

Before choosing Qwik, when I was researching what to use, I found something called `Material for MkDocs`,
and in it, I found something called giscus.

I thought it was nice to be able to easily add a feature to receive comments on the blog.

## Things I Gave Up On The Way

### Changesets

I tried to manage versions using `changesets`, but I gave up halfway.

### Turborepo

I dreamed of a monorepo structure with `turborepo`, but I gave up. The structure I had in mind is as follows.

- apps/docs
- packages/ui
- packages/blog-contents
- packages/translate

However, it was difficult to combine PandaCSS and Qwik's UI library well, and I couldn't realize it.

### Fuse.js

I considered implementing a search function for the blog, but I gave up because it was troublesome to implement it myself.

## Future Prospects

For example, I thought I would like to create a function that supports dark mode or allows changing the theme color.
Also, I'm thinking of trying cucumber using Playwright.
As for the design, I did it from scratch with CSS for the first time, so I want to become stronger in design.
In addition, vercel has announced something called v0, so it seems good to try this.
Also, although I introduced turbo as a monorepo, I haven't fully utilized it, so I want to try speeding up CI by caching.
I also want to try using bun to see if it speeds up.

## In conclusion

Through this renewal, I was able to come into contact with many new technologies and tools.
Each technology has its own charm and learning, and it was a very fulfilling experience.
I would like to continue pursuing new technologies and ideas in the future.
