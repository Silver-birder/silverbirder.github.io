When I went to a shopping mall by car, the parking fee was free for up to one hour from entry, but I had a vague memory of "When did I enter?". At such times, when I looked at the timeline of Google Map, I knew exactly what time and minute I arrived, and I really felt it was convenient.

Also, after eating out, when I thought about writing a review of the place, I had taken pictures of the meal, but sometimes I wondered, "What was the name of this restaurant?". Even at such times, referring to the timeline of Google Map, I can confirm the name of the restaurant I visited, which is very helpful.

From these experiences, I realized that the timeline function of Google Map is a very convenient tool in daily life. Even small details that are easy to forget can be solved with this. Please give it a try.

That's all, I shared a little trivia.
