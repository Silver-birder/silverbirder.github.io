I started studying English and managed to boost my TOEIC score by 285 points in just 6 months. I'm writing this article to share my experience and record my learning journey.

## TOEIC Scores and Study Time

First, let's list my TOEIC scores in chronological order.

| Test Date          | Score | Listening/Reading |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| As of January 2023 | 355   | 215/140           |
| February 26, 2023  | 510   | 280/230           |
| May 27, 2023       | 640   | 320/320           |

As you can see, my score increased by at least 100 points in both the February and May exams. This is partly because my original score was low...

Next, let's look at my study time, as shown in the figure below. These data were obtained from [Study Plus](https://www.studyplus.jp/), a service I use to manage my learning. The study period is from January to June 2023.

As you can see from the figure, I spend more than 30 hours studying each month. Divided by day, I was studying for more than an hour a day. I was unable to secure study time in June due to special circumstances.

## English Learning Method

When my TOEIC score was in the 300s, I was just memorizing English words. I was particularly conscious of the following three points.

1. Remember the part of speech of English words
2. Always use your ears and mouth when memorizing
3. Instead of a little at a time, look at a lot and repeat to remember

For the first point, I made sure to remember not only the translation of the English word, but also whether the word is a verb (transitive/intransitive), noun, adjective, etc. This is important for understanding English grammar, so I always keep it in mind.

For the second point, when memorizing English words, I listened to the pronunciation of the English word with my ears, pronounced it with my mouth, and listened to it with my ears. By remembering the pronunciation, it becomes easier to understand when listening.

For the third point, I tried to remember 100 English words a day, rather than carefully remembering one by one. You may not be able to remember everything on the first day, but if you repeat the same thing for a week, the memory will remain in your eyes and ears, and you will be able to remember efficiently.

The first English word teaching material I used was "Yumetan 0". It's very simple in terms of level, but there were surprisingly words I didn't remember, so I'm glad I used this material.

Next, I tried Kikutan. It was very useful. It allowed me to train by listening to a specific amount of English words and pronouncing them.

## About Continuing English Learning

The biggest challenge in English learning was the continuation of English learning. I had decided to study English for at least one hour every day. However, when work got busy, I would inevitably neglect my English studies. Furthermore, studying English is something to be done steadily, and sometimes it felt very boring. Because the results are not immediately visible, I often felt that my efforts were not rewarded.

Even if I try to continue studying English, my motivation decreases and I stop learning. I can spend as much time as I want on things I like, but when it comes to studying English, there is a part of me that can't say I like it that much. When it's difficult to continue learning, the following three methods are effective.

1. **Think about the time you were able to do rather than the time you couldn't**: Continuity is important, even if it's just a few minutes. Value the sense of satisfaction.
2. **Create a community**: By praising each other or complaining together, you can maintain your learning motivation.
3. **Regularly visualize results with numbers such as TOEIC or word tests**: By seeing your progress concretely, you can maintain your learning motivation.

## The Joy of Learning English and Its Impact

The joy I felt in continuing to study English was not just about improving my TOEIC score. Every time I had more opportunities to come into contact with English in my daily life, I had more moments where I could feel my growth, such as being able to understand, read, and understand new meanings.

The experience at work was also a great joy. I had a sudden meeting one-on-one with a foreigner whose native language was not Japanese, and I caused trouble for the other person, but I managed to carry on the conversation and finish the intended discussion. At that time, I strongly felt the joy of my words being understood by the other person.

Each time I experienced these small joys, my motivation increased. I feel these are very important experiences in continuing to learn English.

## What to Do Next

My goal is to score 700 points on the TOEIC. To do this, I will repeatedly study to improve my listening and reading skills.
Once I exceed 700 points, I plan to move on to practicing speaking as the next step. For this, I plan to look for instant English composition training and appropriate services.
