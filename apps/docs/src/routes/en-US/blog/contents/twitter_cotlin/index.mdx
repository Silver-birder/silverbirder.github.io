I created a tool called Cotlin to collect links posted on Twitter.

From this, I named it Cotlin. It's similar to that thing on Android.

# Motivation

I have attended technical conferences using [connpass](https://connpass.com/) and others.
The materials presented at the conference are often published on Twitter, so I wanted to create a tool that could automatically collect them. That's why I created Cotlin.

# Tech Stack

It's Google Apps Script ([Clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp/)) + Twitter API ([tweet search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)).
I have [published a library](https://github.com/silverbirder/Cotlin#use-by-google-apps-script), and based on that, I have prepared sample code so that you can easily create [API](https://github.com/silverbirder/Cotlin/blob/master/sample/api.js) and [Client](https://github.com/silverbirder/Cotlin/blob/master/sample/client.js). The usage is all in the [README.md](https://github.com/silverbirder/Cotlin/blob/master/README.md).

# Challenges

All links described in a Tweet are shortened to [t.co](https://help.twitter.com/ja/using-twitter/url-shortener).
To get the original URL from this shortened URL, you need to redirect.
When I actually created it, as I wrote in the following article, there were some challenges when writing with GAS.

So, I was developing in Golang to parallelize the process of requesting multiple redirect URLs.

However, I realized that the original URL is included in the response of the Twitter API ([tweet search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)) ([expanded_url](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets)), and eventually, I ended up developing with Google Apps Script ([Clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp/)).

# What Went Well

I have automated the process of collecting presentation materials every day and recording them in a spreadsheet.  
※ Due to circumstances, only URL links and Tweet links are listed.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaJOw9-GdoHhz3D0CzvJfFitrmEN8KpgIleer9rmxiw/edit?usp=sharing

I have been able to discover the following types of materials.

- Presentation materials from **around the world**
- Materials from **technical conferences I didn't know about**
- Materials **individuals and students** have made public

From there, I had the following good experiences.

- "There was someone else who was struggling with testing just like me. They're solving it with a technology called ○○! I didn't know!"
- "This is a document on the architecture of ○○, which I've been interested in lately. The pros and cons are well summarized, which is great!"
- "This is a story from a company that is implementing remote work. I'm going to be working remotely too, so I'll get to know their insights in advance!"

Reading materials every day, I come across 2 or 3 items a day that touch my heartstrings. I was very stimulated and glad I made it.

# In Conclusion

My motivation to participate in technical conferences, in fact, has been decreasing recently.
There are various reasons, but I'll leave them aside.

With tools like this, you can cast a wide net.
Thanks to this, I've been able to catch up on various interests.

I plan to keep updating the above spreadsheet, so please make use of it.
