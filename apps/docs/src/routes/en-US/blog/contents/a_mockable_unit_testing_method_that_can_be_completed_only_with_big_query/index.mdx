BigQuery, do you use it?
I am building data using BigQuery in my work.
For quality assurance, I want to test against BigQuery SQL.
In this article, I will introduce a unit testing method that can be completed only with BigQuery and can replace Mock data.

## Motivation

To put it simply, we want to check whether degregation occurs when modifying BigQuery SQL.

We write BigQuery SQL in our work, but we don't have unit tests for it.

When developing applications in languages such as Python or Javascript, it is common to write unit tests using unit testing frameworks such as XUnit.
However, I have not heard of unit tests for SQL (as far as I have observed).

It seems that you can use a tool called dbt (Data Build Tool) to apply unit tests to SQL, but I don't know the pros and cons of that. (Out of curiosity, I'd like to give it a try).

Instead, I was wondering if I could write unit tests for SQL using the **standard techniques** of the language, rather than learning a new library/tool.

So I came up with my own unit test method for BigQuery SQL.

## xUnit

xUnit is a framework for unit testing.

> xUnit is the collective name for several unit testing frameworks that derive their structure and functionality from Smalltalk's SUnit.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit

xUnit has influenced each programming language.
It allows unit testing of JUnit for Java and unittest (strictly inspired by JUnit) for Python.

## xUnit x Python

Before BigQuery, we first introduce unit tests using Python.

Suppose you have a function `get_less_than`, which `get_less_than` fruits that cost less than 100 yen.

```python
# fruits.py
class Fruits(object):
    def _get_fruits(self):
        return [
            {"price": 130, "name": "apple"},
            {"price": 120, "name": "banana"},
            {"price": 110, "name": "grape"},
            {"price": 100, "name": "lemon"},
            {"price": 90, "name": "orange"},
        ]


    def get_less_than(self, price):
        fruits = self._get_fruits()
        return list(filter(lambda x: x["price"] < price, fruits))
```

The `_get_fruits` function is a simplified one, where the actual data is referenced.

If you were to write unit tests for the `get_less_than` function, the code would look like this.

```python
# test_fruits.py
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from fruits import Fruits

class TestFruits(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch("fruits.Fruits._get_fruits")
    def test_get_less_than(self, mock_get_fruits):
        # Arrange
        mock_get_fruits.return_value = [
            {"price": 110, "name": "apple"},
            {"price": 100, "name": "banana"},
            {"price": 90, "name": "orange"},
        ]
        fruits = Fruits()


        # Act
        actual = fruits.get_less_than(price=100)


        # Assert
        assert len(actual) == 1
```

[Best Practices for Writing Unit Tests#Placement of tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices#arranging-your- tests), unit tests are easier to understand if they are written in the following three phases.

1. Arrange: placement, preparation
1. Act: execute
   Assert: verification

Unit tests can be run with the command

```shell
$ python -m unittest test_fruits
.

---

Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK.
```

The test succeeded. Now let's make it fail.
Change the `get_less_than` logic in the fruits.py code to the wrong one.
The code is as follows.

```python
# fruits.py
class Fruits(object):
    ...
    def get_less_than(self, price):
        fruits = self._get_fruits()
        # return list(filter(lambda x: x["price"] < price, fruits))
        return list(filter(lambda x: x["price"] <= price, fruits))
```

With this in place, let's run the unit test we just ran.

```shell
$ python3 -m unittest test_fruits
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_get_less_than (test_fruits.TestFruits)

    assert len(actual) == 1

```

Failed, as expected.
**Missing logic** is **almost certain** to occur in the course of continued maintenance.
When this happens, it is important to be able to recognise that **logic is wrong**, i.e. to recognise degreasing.
One of the advantages of writing unit tests is that you can detect **degrees**.

## xUnit x BigQuery

How do we test BigQuery?
First, you need to prepare your source data for writing BigQuery SQL.

```sql
-- fruits_ct.sql
-- destination: shop
-- dataset: shop
-- table: fruits
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  shop.fruits AS
SELECT
  price, name
  SELECT price, name
FROM (
  SELECT
    130 AS price, "apple" AS name
    "apple" AS name
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    120 AS price, "apple" AS name
    "banana" AS name
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    110 AS price, "grape" AS name
    "grape" AS name
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    100 AS price, "lemon" AS name
    "lemon" AS name
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    90 AS price, "orange" AS name )
    "orange" AS name )
```

From the shop.fruits table, prepare the SQL equivalent of the `get_less_than` function from the Python code above.

```sql
-- fruits_less_than_100.sql
-- destination.
-- dataset: shop
-- table: fruits_less_than_100
SELECT
  price, name
  SELECT price, name
FROM
  shop.fruits
WHERE
  price < 100
```

Write unit tests against the output `fruits_less_than_100` table.

```sql
-- test_fruits_less_than_100.sql
ASSERT
  (
  SELECT
    COUNT(name) = 1
  FROM
    shop.fruits_less_than_100) AS "There's one fruit less than 100."
```

This test ensured that for the `fruits_less_than_100` table

- There's one fruit with a price less than 100.

However, this is data generated by reference to real data (shop.fruits table).
Therefore, the following problems exist

- The test is unstable because it refers to real data
  - The test fails if `orange` is missing in the real data
- Long feedback cycles.
  - The more real data there is, the longer the test execution time becomes.

Therefore, table functions are used to replace real data with mock data.

## What is a table function?

From the official BigQuery page, the following is written about table functions.

> A table function (also known as a table value function or TVF) is a user-defined function that returns a table. Table functions can be used wherever tables can be used. Table functions are similar to views, but table functions can take parameters.

- [Table functions|BigQuery|Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/table-functions)

The definition of a table function has the following sample code.

```sql
-- names_by_year.tvf.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  FUNCTION mydataset.names_by_year(y INT64) AS
SELECT
  YEAR,
  name,
  SUM(number) AS total
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE
  year = y
GROUP BY
  year, y
  NAME
```

Features `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION`. It defines a function and takes the table information as the return value. In this case, it is a table with fields `year, name, total`.

The defined table function is used as follows.

```sql
-- names_by_year.sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  mydataset.names_by_year(1950)
ORDER BY
  total DESC
LIMIT
  5
```

Table functions can be used in the `FROM clause`. This is where I focused my attention.
I wondered if it would be possible to return mock data when calling a function in a FROM clause.

I found a means to do this in the following chapter.

## xUnit x BigQuery (Mock)

How to replace the data is to turn it into a table function in the following two orders.

1. make the original data into a table function so that it can be replaced by Mock
1. replace the FROM clause of the SQL containing the logic with the table function in (1) and convert it to a table function.

The following steps are explained in order.

---The first is to replace the `source data' with the `source data'.

The first step is to convert the `original data into a table function so that it can be replaced with Mock.

The original data is the `shop.fruits` table, so it is converted to a table function so that it can be replaced by Mock.
The following code is a Mock replaceable table function.

```sql
-- fruits_tvf.sql
-- function:.
-- - shop.fruits_inject().
-- - shop.fruits(is_test BOOL)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  FUNCTION shop.fruits_inject() AS
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT
    130 AS price,
    "apple" AS name )
WHERE
  1 <> 1;
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  FUNCTION shop.fruits(is_test BOOL) AS
SELECT
  name,
  SELECT name, price
FROM
  shop.fruits
WHERE
  NOT is_test
UNION ALL
SELECT
  name,
  SELECT name, price
FROM
  shop.fruits_inject()
WHERE
  is_test
```

This SQL contains two statements.

1. definition of the table function shop.fruits_inject
1. definition of the table function shop.fruits

The first is a function for later Mock replacement (overwriting).

The second is a function with the value `is_test BOOL` as an argument, with the following conditional branch.

- If `is_test` is True
  - Mock data (shop.fruits_inject) is returned
- If is_test is False
  - Real data (shop.fruits) is returned.

It is assumed that is_test is False for production code and is_test is True for test code.

---

The second one is `replacing the FROM clause of SQL containing logic with the table function in (1) to make it a table function`.

The SQL containing logic, in this case the `fruits_less_than_100` table, is converted to a function.
The following code is the table function replaced by the table function in (1).

```sql
-- fruits_less_than_tvf.sql
-- function:
-- - shop.fruits_less_than(is_test BOOL, p INT)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  FUNCTION shop.fruits_less_than(is_test BOOL,
    p INT) AS
SELECT
  price, name, p INT
  FUNCTION shop.fruits_less_than(is_test BOOL p INT)
FROM
  shop.fruits(is_test)
WHERE
  price < p
```

In the FROM clause, call the shop.fruits table function defined in item (i) above.
The arguments of the shop.fruits table function are set to the `is_test BOOL` passed from the shop.fruits_less_than function.
The shop.fruits_less_than function also has an argument `p INT` to allow flexibility in the price of the less_than.

---

This completes the table functionisation. Next, I will show you the product code and test code.

Let's write the production code first.

```sql
-- fruits_less_than_100.sql
-- destination.
-- dataset: shop
-- table: fruits_less_than_100
SELECT
  price,
  name,
FROM
  shop.fruits_less_than(False, 100)
```

There is nothing important to take away. The production code sets is_test to False.

The following is the main part of this article, the unit test code for **BigQuery's SQL**.

```sql
-- test_fruits_less_than_100.sql
-- arrange
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  FUNCTION shop.fruits_inject() AS
SELECT
  110 AS price,
  "grape" AS name
UNION ALL
SELECT
  100 AS price, "lemon" AS name
  "lemon" AS name
UNION ALL
SELECT
  90 AS price, "lemon" AS name; "orange" AS name; "lemon" AS name
  "orange" AS name;
-- ACT
  CREATE TEMP TABLE fruits_less_than_100 AS
SELECT
  price,
  name,
FROM
  shop.fruits_less_than(True,
    100);
-- assert
ASSERT
  (
  SELECT
    COUNT(name) = 1
  FROM
    fruits_less_than_100) AS "There's one fruit less than 100."
```

This SQL has three statements.

1. shop.fruits_inject function override (**mock insert**)
1. shop.fruits_less_than function, generated with is_test=True and saved in a temporary table
1. assertion against the temporary table in (ii)

Importantly, number (i) overrides the shop.fruits_inject function.
Then the shop.fruits_inject function result referenced by the shop.fruits function is switched to the overwritten one.

Afterwards, call the shop.fruits_less_than function at (ii) to save the temporary table, and make an assertion at (iii).

Now let's make the test fail. Rewrite the shop.fruits_less_than function, which contains the logic, as follows.

```sql
-- fruits_less_than_tvf.sql
-- function:
-- - shop.fruits_less_than(is_test BOOL, p INT)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  FUNCTION shop.fruits_less_than(is_test BOOL,
    p INT) AS
SELECT
  price, name, p INT
  FUNCTION shop.fruits_less_than(is_test BOOL p INT)
FROM
  shop.fruits(is_test)
WHERE
  -- price < p
  price <= p
```

Since the price in the WHERE clause is less than or equal to 100 instead of less than 100, two items are extracted, `orange` and `lemon`.

Let's redefine this function and run the test again.
If you do so, you will get the following message.

```
Query error: there's one fruit less than 100. at [25:1].
```

As expected, the test failed! 🎉

Once you are able to unit test BigQuery, you will next want to incorporate it into your CI.
Since BigQuery is a GCP service, we will make use of Cloud Build, a well-known GCP CI service.
The definition file for Cloud Build is shown below.

```yaml
-- cloudbuild.yaml
steps:
  # If you want to receive notifications from Slack, uncomment it.
  # Then follow the README.md at the following URL to set it up.
  # https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/slackbot
  # - name: "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/slackbot"
  #   id: "WATCH"
  #   args: [
  #     "--build", "$BUILD_ID",
  #     "--webhook", "$_SLACK_WEB_HOOK"
  #   ]
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud-slim
    id: fruits_ct
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: ['run_query.sh', 'fruits_ct.sql']
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud-slim
    id: fruits_tvf
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: ['run_query.sh', 'fruits_tvf.sql']
    waitFor:
      - fruits_ct
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud-slim
    id: fruits_less_than_tvf
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: ['run_query.sh', 'fruits_less_than_tvf.sql']
    waitFor:
      - fruits_tvf
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud-slim
    id: test_fruits_less_than_100
    entrypoint: 'bash'
    args: ['run_query.sh', 'test_fruits_less_than_100.sql']
    waitFor:
      - fruits_less_than_tvf
```

```shell
#! /bin/bash
# run_query.sh
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "No arguments supplied"
fi
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < $1
```

If you integrate Cloud Build with Git platforms such as Github, you can run unit tests on every Git event (Push, Merge, etc.).

- The `id:fruits_ct`, `id:fruits_tvf` and `id:fruits_less_than_tvf` in the sample cloudbuild.yaml are not meant to run many times,
  I write this for clarity of the article.

## xUnit x BigQuery advantages and disadvantages

This section lists the advantages and disadvantages of BigQuery's Mock replaceable unit tests.

- Advantages.
  - You only need to learn BigQuery.
    - Complete with only the standard BigQuery functionality
  - Short feedback cycle
    - Because it does not refer to real data, but mock data
  - Testing is stable
    - Because it references mock data instead of real data
- Disadvantages
  - Need to control SQL execution order of BigQuery
    - In this case, it is necessary to execute queries in the following order
      - 1. fruits_tvf.sql
      - 2. fruits_less_than_tvf.sql
      - 3. test_fruits_less_than_100.sql
    - Workaround.
      - Use BigQuery Scripting
      - Use `waitFor` in Cloud Build
  - Unexpected behaviour when running in parallel
    - Define table functions with `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION
      - shop.fruits_inject function is redefined many times
    - `CREATE TEMP TABLE FUNCTION` is not supported
    - Workaround.
      - Use BigQuery transactions
        - Table functions not supported
  - Not versatile
    - Cannot use the same technique (table functions) for other database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
      - Workaround
        - Use dbt (maybe).

## Conclusion

This time, we found that we can write unit tests for BigQuery SQL by using this technique.
This makes it possible to develop safely while ensuring a certain level of quality for the data.

Other testing techniques you may also want to consider include

- Data model testing with dbt
- Policy testing with Open Policy Agent (OPA)
  - SQL decomposition into AST → JSON and testing with OPA
- Unit testing using BigQuery client library

## P.S.

I would like to try dbt.
