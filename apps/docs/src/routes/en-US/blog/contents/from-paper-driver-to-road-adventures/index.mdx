I was a paper driver and it has been 4 months since I bought my new car.
At first I was full of anxiety, but now I look forward to my week of driving.
Here is the process that led to this change.

## August 2023 - The dream of having a car
I had the opportunity to visit Shizuoka Prefecture for family business.
Shizuoka is an area where it is difficult to live without a car, and thanks to my friends I realized how free and convenient it is to get around by car.
They took me to shopping malls, fashionable cafes, and bustling markets,
I experienced a variety of places that could easily be visited with a car.

These experiences made me realize how much I wanted to have the freedom to drive myself and go anywhere I wanted,
I made up my mind to buy a car.

## September 2023 - I chose a car with my father as my companion.
I had no knowledge at all about cars, so buying an expensive car was a big concern for me.
So, I visited a car shop (dealer) with my father, who knew a lot about cars, and we went to select a light car.

As we visited various dealers and talked with sales representatives, I borrowed my father's advice,
I chose a car that was safe and easy for me, a paper driver, to drive.

Often I overheard my father negotiating with the sales representatives, asking them if they could help me learn a little more.
I was surprised to later learn that this one word was actually part of the discount negotiation. (What do you mean "study"?!).

In the end, we chose a new car, a Nissan, before minor changes,
We were able to get a discount of about 200,000-300,000 yen.

## October 2023 - Delivery and preparation
I made arrangements for parking, signed up for voluntary insurance, and prepared my ETC card for the delivery date.
To gain confidence in my driving skills, I took an on-site driving course and also practiced driving with my father.
I don't remember if I learned this at the driving school, but it was the first time I learned when to use the hazard lamps.

As I had a MT license, operating an AT car was relatively easy for me, but I was not good at the technique of parking a car in a garage.
Therefore, I actively studied at home, for example, by using YouTube to learn tips for parking a car in a garage.
I also re-learned about signs and traffic rules.

Thanks to these preparations and practices, I was finally able to confidently drive the car from the dealership on the day of delivery.
I was able to drive the car to a parking lot near my home.

## November 2023 - Developing Confidence in Driving
With my wife in the passenger seat, I gradually expanded my driving range.
I started with short distances, then tried driving in the rain, driving at night, and finally driving alone.
These experiences gave me more confidence in my driving.

It is a secret that I practiced parking in a parking lot with no cars at all for about an hour.

These steps built up and finally I was able to drive a car by myself without any worries and to expand my range of activities,
I am now able to drive alone with peace of mind and greatly expand my range of activities.

## December 2023 - Driving Days
As my confidence in driving has grown, I have come to enjoy driving to a variety of destinations.
These range from large shopping malls, cafes and hospitals inaccessible by public transportation, natural hot springs, and sprawling DIY stores.
Initially, I chose spacious multi-story parking lots, but eventually I was able to park my car smoothly in smaller spaces.

Especially on weekends, I enjoy going out by car whenever I find time.
I have had a few near-misses, though, in which I encountered unexpected situations,
I learned an important lesson: "When in doubt, wait.

As my confidence grew, so did my collection of car accessories.
Chargers, triangle markers, cleaning supplies, charms, cushions, deodorant, and other items that make driving more comfortable and safer.

## January 2024 - Shizuoka again
I had the opportunity to visit Shizuoka Prefecture again.
However, feeling that I did not want to drive in the snow, I took the Shinkansen to Shizuoka Prefecture.
I felt even more strongly than during my previous visit that I would like to visit Shizuoka Prefecture by car someday! I felt even more strongly than during my previous visit that "I would love to visit Shizuoka Prefecture by car someday!

## February 2024 - A New Challenge
My longing to go away from home is getting stronger, and I am planning trips to Shiga, Aichi, and Wakayama prefectures.
I have yet to experience highway driving since I was a paper driver, so I would like to practice.
I will choose highways with short distances and little traffic.

## End
Looking back, I wish I had purchased a car earlier. Now a car has become an indispensable pleasure in my life.
Someday, I will go to Shizuoka Prefecture!
