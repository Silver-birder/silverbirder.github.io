Since January 2022, I started using Ruby on Rails (hereinafter, Rails) at my new workplace.
I have experience with PHP's CakePHP, Node.js's Express, and Python's Flask, but
I had a hard time getting used to Rails. I will try to articulate this loosely.
By the way, this was also my first time using Ruby.

## Rails Doctrine

As I was learning a new web framework called Rails, I wanted to know what philosophy it was built on.
So, I roughly read the following page.

- https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine

With principles like PoLS and CoC, I think it's good that programmers have fewer unnecessary worries.
I totally agree that it doesn't really matter whether it's post_id or postId in the column name of the DB table.
I also think that there would be less controversy since the directory structure is determined by CoC.

## Unfamiliar Parts

First of all, I should mention that I am unfamiliar with both Ruby and Rails.

- I can't tell the difference between functions without arguments and variables

This is a common story I hear about Ruby.
I struggled with this when reading the code.

- I don't know if it's a Ruby function, a Rails function, or a custom function

When I read Rails code at work, I always wonder whether it's a Ruby function,
a Rails function, or a custom function.

- I thought migration meant transition

In the context of Rails, migration seems to refer to Ruby code for DB management.
I felt strange that it's not called DB migration.

## In Conclusion

I think Rails is very convenient as it does a lot of things for you,
but sometimes I get lost and wonder how it works.

I think it's a trade-off, but I'm still not used to it these days.
