I discovered `container-structure-test`, a tool for verifying whether the structure and settings within a Docker image are as expected.

[container-structure-test GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test)

Decided to give it a try.

## Setup

First, install `container-structure-test`. For MacOS, it can be easily installed using Homebrew.

```sh
brew install container-structure-test
```

Next, prepare a Dockerfile for building the test target Docker image as shown below and build the image.

```Dockerfile
# ./Dockerfile
# @see: https://github.com/silverbirder/testcontainers-nextjs/blob/main/Dockerfile

# ...

##### RUNNER

FROM --platform=linux/amd64 node:18.17-alpine3.18 AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV production

# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

The build command is as follows:

```sh
docker build . -t app:latest
```

This command builds the Docker image with the tag `app:latest`.

## Testing with container-structure-test

`container-structure-test` allows for executing various tests on the built Docker image. 
You can start the tests with the following command:

```sh
container-structure-test test \
  --image app:latest \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --config config.yml
```

`config.yml` contains the settings for the tests you want to execute. Below is an example:

```yml
# config.yml
schemaVersion: "2.0.0"
commandTests:
  - name: "cat server.js"
    command: "cat"
    args: ["server.js"]
    expectedOutput: [".*startServer.*"]
fileContentTests:
  - name: "package.json"
    expectedContents: ["testcontainers-nextjs"]
    path: "/app/package.json"
fileExistenceTests:
  - name: "package.json"
    path: "/app/package.json"
    shouldExist: true
    permissions: '-rw-r--r--'
    uid: 1001
    gid: 1001
metadataTest:
  envVars:
    - key: PORT
      value: 3000
    - key: NODE_ENV
      value: production
  exposedPorts: ["3000"]
  cmd: ["node", "server.js"]
  workdir: "/app"
  user: "nextjs"
# licenseTests:
# - debian: true
#   files: ["/foo/bar", "/baz/bat"]
```

`container-structure-test` can execute the following types of tests:

* **commandTests**
  * Executes commands from the image and verifies if the expected output is obtained.
* **fileContentTests**
  * Tests whether specific files contain the expected content.
* **fileExistenceTests**
  * Verifies the existence, permissions, and ownership of files.
* **metadataTest**
  * Validates metadata such as environment variables, exposed ports, the executing user, etc.
* **licenseTests**
  * Checks the list of copyright files to ensure that only licenses approved by Google are used.

For more details, please visit the [container-structure-test GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test).

**commandTests** seem to create a Docker container to execute the CMD for testing. It looks promising for ensuring that errors, warnings, or security logs do not occur.

**fileContentTests** didn't immediately suggest a use case.

**fileExistenceTests** seem useful for checking things that should not be allowed by verifying permissions, uid, and gid.

**metadataTest** appears suitable for testing the application's necessary environment variables with regular expressions.

**licenseTests** did not immediately suggest a use case either.

## Conclusion

`container-structure-test` is a tool for automatically verifying whether a Docker image meets the expected specifications. Take advantage of the basic usage and test examples introduced in this article to build a safe and reliable container environment.
