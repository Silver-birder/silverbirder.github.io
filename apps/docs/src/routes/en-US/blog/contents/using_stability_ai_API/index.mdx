Stable Diffusion is an open-source AI that generates images when you give it text.
If you want to run it on your own PC, you will need a GPU.
(There is also [stable_diffusion.openvino](https://github.com/bes-dev/stable_diffusion.openvino) that can run on a CPU)

I wanted an API that could be used on any PC and could be integrated with services like Slack.
So, I developed an API for Stable Diffusion.

## Conclusion

I used the SDK of DreamStudio.ai, [stability-sdk](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stability-sdk).

The artifact is placed in the following repository.

- https://github.com/silverbirder/stable-diffusion-API

It works in both local environments and Docker containers.

To run it, you will need the API Key of DreamStudio.ai.
Since it runs on Docker, it can run anywhere if the service can deploy Docker. (No GPU is required)

I like GCP, so I deployed it to a service called CloudRun.
The API accepts parameters in the form of `<url>/?prompt=<text>` and returns an image.

When I used it on Slack, it looked like this.

  height={778}
  layout="constrained"

For now, I was able to run Stable Diffusion with the API.

## GPU and Design

Before using [stability-sdk](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stability-sdk), I thought about designing an environment to run Stable Diffusion on my own. I have left a memo of the design research in the following link.

- https://zenn.dev/silverbirder/scraps/3842c715662551

Specifically, I considered the following patterns.

1. Run Stable Diffusion using the GPU of Google Colaboratory and publish it with a simple API
2. Run Stable Diffusion using a GPU on a server (such as GCE or CloudRun) and publish it with a simple API
3. Run Stable Diffusion using a GPU in a batch (Cloud Batch) and run it when necessary. (Kick the batch process from the API)

The first one has a 12-hour limit on the use of Google Colaboratory, and something is needed to circumvent that. However, I rejected it because I think it deviates from the original purpose.

The second one is rejected because it would cost tens to hundreds of thousands of yen in running costs.

The third one was the first one I conceived. It would be a waste to have a GPU server running all the time like the second one, so I thought about the third option as a batch process. When I actually built it with the third option, (I haven't investigated the cause in depth) it took more than 30 minutes to start up, and it didn't seem to be usable.

So, after some consideration, I realized that [stability-sdk](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stability-sdk) seemed to be a quick solution that required no maintenance or running costs.

Of course, there are disadvantages.

- Dependence on the SDK, which you can't control (you can't do img2img)
- Pay-as-you-go system

However, assuming it was for personal use, I judged the advantages to outweigh the disadvantages.

## stability-sdk

DreamStudio.ai uses Stable Diffusion.
They publish [stability-sdk](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stability-sdk) as an API.
You need to write in Python to use it.
Reading the source code, I think it's relatively easy to write the SDK in another language because it uses gRPC.
I wrote it quickly in Python, using flask and stability-sdk.

For now, I wrote an ultra-simple API that only accepts Prompts.
[stability-sdk](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stability-sdk) has various parameters, so I thought about making it accept those as well, and I thought it would be interesting to write something like a bot for Midjourney's discord.

## In conclusion

In Markdown, when you load an image, if you specify the API I developed this time, the image changes every time you open the Markdown.
You can fix it by specifying the prompt and seed, but I think this is interesting too.
