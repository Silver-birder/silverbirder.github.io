I resigned from the company where I was working as a full-time employee at the end of June 2023. My tenure was 1 year and 6 months, which was a short period for me. I was highly motivated towards my work and had a good environment where I could work cheerfully with my team members. However, due to the following reasons, my work-life balance was disrupted, and I decided to resign. This article is for sorting out my feelings.

- Studying due to the company's Englishization
- Moving and commuting by bullet train due to various circumstances
- A year of trying to conceive with my wife and infertility issues
- Preparing for surgery and caring for my elderly grandmother

## Englishization

Due to the company's policy, I had to start studying English. My TOEIC score was low, and I felt that I had to study harder than anyone else because I was late in starting English training due to various circumstances.

I started studying English in January 2023, and during weekdays, we all agreed as a team to study for an hour. In addition, I decided to study for an hour at night. I also study for an hour on weekends.

## Commuting by Bullet Train

Originally, I was aware of commuting by bullet train and utilized the company's relocation system to belong to a base in a distant region. At that time, my residence was in a location easily accessible to the bullet train, so going to the office was easy. Also, I only had to go to the office once a week. However, my grandparents became elderly, and I took over the vacant house they owned. The vacant house is located far from the bullet train, so my commuting time became 6 hours round trip. The move was around April 2023.

## Trying to Conceive

My wife and I love children. My wife used to be a childcare worker and resigned at the end of March 2023. There were several reasons, but one of them was that we were planning to get pregnant. From 2022, we started going to the clinic to start trying to conceive. Initially, we were trying timing therapy while concurrently conducting tests for my wife and me. Due to various circumstances, my test results were revealed around May 2023. The result was dysfunction, meaning that I was the problem that we couldn't have children, and I felt very sorry for my wife and relatives. Still, I started living a healthy life, such as taking medicine and starting running, hoping to improve somehow.

## Caregiving

My grandmother, who is over 80 years old, has had bad legs for a long time, and it seemed that her legs would soon stop moving. Because she didn't move her legs, she stopped exercising, and her blood sugar level kept rising (HbA1c 9%). She was going to have surgery on her legs, but it seems that she can't have surgery if her blood sugar level is high. Because her legs were bad, she often drowned in the bathtub, and I rescued her each time, but it was a very dangerous situation. Because it was a matter of life and death, my grandfather and parents became emotional and started to fight fiercely. I love my grandparents and parents, but I felt sad every time they fought. About once a week, I went to my grandparents' house, helped with housework, and listened to my grandparents' stories (complaints and anxieties). This caregiving started around the end of May 2023.

## Result

Due to these factors, my private mental load increased, my private time was reduced due to studying English, the physical burden increased due to commuting by bullet train, and my work-life balance was disrupted. As a result, I visited a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with depression. I was prescribed medication, but I didn't feel much effect.

My emotions became very unstable. I was extremely swayed by anger and sadness for trivial stress, and I quickly got angry and cried. However, I tried not to bring it to work. I felt that this was not good, and I proposed a contract, but in the end, I decided to resign.

## Reflection

Around April 2023, I felt that my emotions were about to overflow. I started to think that there might be a problem if this continued. After that, I had a series of events such as English learning, commuting by bullet train, trying to conceive, and caregiving, and various things happened while I was wondering how to solve these problems. I also overate and wasted money to relieve stress. I might have done these actions unconsciously. Stress relief is a temporary measure, and if the problem continues, stress will only accumulate. Looking back now, I might have kept the problem to myself because it was hard to consult with my wife and family. My recognition at that time was, "I feel like my emotions are about to overflow, but if I can overcome this now..."

Looking back, I feel that **it's important to let go of something when you're holding onto something else**. For example, in learning English, I should have let go of the desire to catch up with others and should have learned at my own pace. Also, when it was confirmed that I would be commuting on the Shinkansen for long hours, I should have given up on going to the office or moved to another base. When my infertility was diagnosed during our attempts to conceive and I was depressed, I should have faced my wife and taken a good rest. In the issue of caregiving, I should have taken a caregiving leave or reconsidered my work style until my grandmother's surgery was over. Of course, all of these are after the fact, and I don't know if I could have actually done that if I went back in time. However, I think that by having the awareness to let go of something when I'm holding onto something else, I could have taken better actions.

## Present

I am currently unemployed. Since I left my job, I don't need to study English or commute. We are also temporarily suspending our attempts to conceive. I visit my grandmother's house frequently. As a result of letting go of various things, my emotional overflow has recovered, and I have gained some leeway in my heart. Therefore, I feel like spending time on my hobbies. I am doing things like weight training, going out, developing apps, and writing. However, sometimes I question myself, "Is this okay?" I consult with my wife and relatives, and they advise me not to rush.

I have inherited a vacant house, so I don't have to worry about rent or loans. Therefore, I am hardly in financial trouble at the moment. However, I was thinking about starting a part-time job because I felt it was strange that I had no income at all. At that time, I had the opportunity to talk with Findy's customer success, and they proposed a business contract. Then, through Findy Freelance, I was thankfully offered a project. I work about 2 or 3 times a week, but the hourly wage is high (compared to a regular part-time job), so I thought this was a good opportunity.

I plan to start working little by little from tomorrow.
