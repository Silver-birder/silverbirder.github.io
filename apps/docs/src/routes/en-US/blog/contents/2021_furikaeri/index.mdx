The year 2021 is now just around the corner. I will leave my reflections on this year on my blog.

## Technology

### Full stack engineering

This year, I experienced a lot of full-stack development in my work.
Up until last year, I had done a lot of web application development, but this year I did a lot of cloud infrastructure and data construction work.
I also experienced the operation of products built from scratch, which I thought helped me develop a wider range of engineering skills compared to last year.

The specific software I experienced was [Resume##Career](... /... /... /resume/index.mdx) for your reference. Briefly, GCP/Terraform for cloud infrastructure, BigQuery and Digdag for data building.

### Job change.

This is my second company.
The first company was a SIer and the second company I worked for was an in-house service company.
The first two companies I worked for did not change jobs (for various reasons).
Therefore, the third company was the first time I experienced job search activities such as casual interviews and self-analysis.

For more information on this job search, see [Impressions after 10 casual interviews](...) /my_feedback_after_taking_casual_interviews_with_10_companies_in_2_months/index.mdx).

Changing jobs has led me to consider the following

- My career development
- My market value
- What I can do, what I want to do, what I should do.

## Life

### Wedding photos

The wedding has not yet taken place because the convergence of the coronas was not in sight.
As we could not make any plans if we waited for the convergence of the corona, we decided to at least take wedding anniversary photos.
As the day of the photo shoot was set for around mid-March 2021, we planned to take photos with a beautiful view of cherry blossoms in the background.

For example, we thought of the following.

- Hire the chapel at Osaka Castle.
- Have a professional photographer take photos
- Wear both Japanese and Western-style clothing.

The last option, "Wear both Japanese and Western clothes", would have meant a tight schedule due to costume changes, so we decided to only wear Western clothes.

On the day of the shoot, the weather was overcast, but thanks to the photographer and the chapel staff, who made the occasion more relaxed, we were able to take photos in a very sunny atmosphere.
My wife and I shared the photos with our parents, who were very pleased.

### Honeymoon.

We went on our honeymoon.
At first we were thinking of going abroad, but considering the risk of infection, we decided to go within Japan.
So we headed to Halekulani Okinawa, the perfect honeymoon resort, and from there we came up with a five-day, four-night schedule.

We decided to do something we don't normally experience very often, so we looked into SUPs and cruises.
My wife and I had a lot of fun coming up with a schedule, and we had some conflicting opinions and fights, but it was a good memory.

Again, though, the honeymoon weather was not favourable and we had to change some plans,
Perhaps because we had experienced this kind of situation many times, we were able to rearrange our schedule flexibly and enjoyed playing freely.

I think I ran as fast as I could from the centre of Taketomi Island to the boat pier, which was a bit too much on the spur of the moment. (Laughter)

## Aspirations for next year

Next year will be even busier than this year.
On the technical side, I will be working at a new place from 4 January next year, and the change in environment will be exhausting.
On the life side, I have to consider big purchases such as a car and a house, and I also have to try to have children. (Due to my wife's circumstances, the ban has been lifted.)

Therefore, my ambition for next year is to **keep a balance between challenge and health**.
Since I am still in my 20s, I want to challenge myself in everything without fear of failure.
For example, I would like to explore specialised areas of web front-end and work hard on OSS committer activities.
Other than that, I would like to make an effort to get used to driving a car so that I, a paper driver, can easily go on long trips with my children.

However, if I keep trying, I get tired and stress builds up easily.
I have had a few fights with my wife this year, and I think a lot of the cause is my immaturity.
To give an example of the fights, I was doing household chores (cooking, cleaning, etc.) out of kindness, but I often asked my wife to thank me, which often led to fights. (â‰  kindness).
It is natural, but I will try to convey my feelings through proper conversation, rather than through my actions and attitude.
In particular, I would like to be able to 'do things together or ask for help' and 'in my wife's timing'.

I have known my wife for about nine years, so there are many things I can get through to her without having to say them.

I am a person who tries to do everything by myself, and combined with my meticulous nature, I seem to have a habit of trying to do things perfectly.

## Conclusion.

I hope to gain a lot of experience in the coming year so that I can grow as an engineer and as a person!
