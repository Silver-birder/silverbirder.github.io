# Last Time

In [Starting to Learn Kubernetes Late - 03. Raspberry Pi -](../start_the_learning_kubernetes_03/index.mdx), we introduced Kubernetes to the RaspberryPi environment. Now that we've confirmed it's working properly, we want to start learning right away.

# References

I will proceed by reading the "[Kubernetes Complete Guide](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Kubernetes%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89-impress-top-gear-%E9%9D%92%E5%B1%B1/dp/4295004804/)". The source code is [here](https://github.com/MasayaAoyama/kubernetes-perfect-guide).

In previous posts, I was referring to [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%85%A5%E9%96%80-Kubernetes-Kelsey-Hightower/dp/4873118409/), but the Kubernetes Complete Guide was better for comprehensive learning, so I used that.

# kubectl

> Kubectl is a command line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters

â€» https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/

It is a CLI for operating Kubernetes.

I have organized the ones I often use and summarized the ones that should be minimally remembered when starting.

## 1. apply

```shell
pi@raspi001:~ $ cat << EOF > sample-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: sample-pod
spec:
 containers:
   - name: nginx-container
     image: nginx:1.12
EOF
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl apply -f sample-pod.yaml
pod/sample-pod created
```

In Kubernetes, it seems common to create a manifest file and apply it with `apply`. This is not only for new creation, but also for updates and deletions. There are other CLIs such as `create`, `replace`, and `delete`, but there is not much need to distinguish them because the same operations can be done with `apply`. The manifest files registered with `apply` are saved as history.

## 2. set, get

```shell
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl set image pod sample-pod nginx-container=nginx:1.13
pod/sample-pod image updated
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl get pod sample-pod
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sample-pod   1/1     Running   1          13m
```

In kubectl, you need to tell which resource type (`pod`,`service`,etc) and which resource name it is.
There is also a `label` as a filtering function.

```yaml
# sample-pod-label.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: sample-pod
  labels:
   env: prod
   app: sample
spec:
 containers:
   - name: nginx-container
     image: nginx:1.12
```

```shell
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl get pod -l env=prod
No resources found.
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl apply -f sample-pod-label.yaml
pod/sample-pod configured
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl get pod -l env=prod
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sample-pod   1/1     Running   0          7m23s
```

If you need more detailed information, use `describe`.

```shell
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl describe pod sample-pod
Name:               sample-pod
...
```

â€» There is also a method called `edit` that allows you to edit directly, but it should only be used for temporary measures.
It would be meaningless to have a declarative file.

By the way, you can abbreviate `service` as `svc`.

## 3. debug

```shell
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl exec -it sample-pod /bin/sh
# exit
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl logs sample-pod
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl cp sample-pod.yaml sample-pod:/var/sample-pod.yaml
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl port-forward sample-pod 8888:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8888 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8888 -> 80
```

All of them are operations against `pod`, so there is no need to specify the resource type. You will use them when you need them in development.

## 99. top

Unfortunately, I couldn't get this to work... ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
I don't need it that much right now, so I'll put it off for now.
It seems to have something to do with `calico` or `flannel`, but I don't understand it well enough to solve it.

# Cleaning Up

```shell
pi@raspi001:~ $ kubectl delete pod sample-pod
pod "sample-pod" deleted
```

If you are dealing with multiple pods, `apply --prune` is better than `delete`, but this time it's a single pod, so I directly `delete` it.

# Conclusion

At the beginning, I was anxious about how much I had to learn,
but when I actually started, it wasn't as much as I thought. (I believe there are still many things I don't know)
I gradually got used to the habit of specifying the resource type and resource name as a rule.
I also learned the rough technique of displaying everything with `kubectl get all` when it's troublesome. (laughs)
