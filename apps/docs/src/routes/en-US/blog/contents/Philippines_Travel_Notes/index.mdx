From October 11, 2019 to October 15, 2019, I went to the Philippines for five days. I accompanied a Japanese man (my former senior at work: Kikuchi) and a Filipino woman on their wedding trip. I was deeply indebted to Mr. Kikuchi when I was a newcomer, so I was filled with feelings of celebration. :)

It was my **first overseas trip**, so I was full of excitement until the day. However, that was until I knew about this (↓)...

# Philippine-style Toilet

Philippine-style toilet! 😰 You throw the toilet paper you've wiped with into the trash can!? 😠 💩 Unbelievable...😵

Philippine Toilet I can't do it anymore, senior. I can't go. I'm a clean freak. And, I have a weak stomach... But, I have no choice but to go...

# Off to the Philippines!

On the first day, when we arrived in Cebu, it was already night.

Here I encountered a **dangerous** society. The roads. Cars and motorcycles are running at full speed. There are hardly any traffic lights. I felt that there was almost no spirit of **giving way**. It felt like people who had maximized the assertiveness of Kansai people.

Especially, there were many motorcycles, and many of them were two-seaters. Among them, a family of four (father, mother, and two children) was driving one motorcycle. Although it can't be helped for living, it is very dangerous compared to Japan.

I came to the shopping center. It's a very stylish (vocabulary) illumination.

Kare is a famous dish in Filipino cuisine. I ordered it for dinner.
It shockingly didn't suit my taste at all...
The person who came with me tasted the Kare Kare and said, "**Are you eating dirt?**" I don't know if this is the original taste or the restaurant's unique arrangement.

The hotel on the first day had a toilet where you could flush toilet paper. 😍

# I took a walk in the morning on the second day.

I couldn't see it at night, but there was glass stuck in the wall. It seems to prevent climbing. It's innovative in a way.

I moved to Bohol (Tagbilaran), the hometown of a Filipino woman, by ferry.
Because it was a small (medium?) ferry, it swayed a lot. Also, the sea breeze outside feels good. I personally like being able to enjoy such open places.
The person in the photo is not me. He is my senior at my previous job (Nakamura), a very bright and communicative brother 👍

When I moved from Cebu to Bohol, the countryside feel came out all at once.
This is what I was expecting 👏👏
There are a lot of motorcycles, many stalls, and it's a world full of life.

I came to the supermarket. Compared to Japan, the waiting time at the cash register is incredibly long. It's long. It's long!
The two steps of scanning the product → packing the product in a paper bag take a lot of time. I realized how **refined the cash register operation in Japan** is.
Also, the employees **often slack off**. I had the impression that there were many employees, and because of that, they were not working, chatting with each other, touching their cell phones, and even throwing things at each other with the store's products 😧. Thinking about it, all Japanese people work seriously.

I bought counterfeit brand shoes and bags. I was able to purchase both for 500 pesos (about 1,000 yen).
The cost of living in the Philippines is very cheap. 500ml of water is 20 pesos, about 40 yen. To begin with, the average monthly salary in the Philippines is about 20,000 pesos. Due to the extreme wealth gap, there were many people who were naked and emaciated.

Because it's cheap, I bought a lot of snacks that seem bad for the body (it's okay at times like this!). Yeah, they're all normal! 😄
Popular products had product descriptions in English and Japanese. Everything else seemed to be in the local language, Tagalog.
The hotel on the second day (& third day, fourth day) had a toilet system where you throw toilet paper in the trash can. 😫

After pooping 💩, I was very concerned about the smell of the trash can. It must smell in that space! ... That was not the case 😲. It seems I was too worried. The toilets outside were dirty, but the toilets inside the hotel were kept clean enough. I overcame the toilet problem by **basically using the toilet at the hotel**! 👍

On the morning of the third day, I came to see Tasha. Tasha is a very small and lonely monkey. I heard that if you surprise Tasha, she will die... Quiet!!!

I participated in a tour down the Loboc River. The people living around this river waved their hands at me. I wonder where those people live. 🤔

Boys and girls in red clothes performed music and dance. They were very cute. Even if I didn't understand the language, I enjoyed it!

Next, I experienced a vehicle called a buggy.
No international license is required, and you can speed around the premises. The weather in the Philippines is unpredictable, but miraculously, it did not rain during any of the events. It rained every time I was on the move. **Am I the weather child!?**

  height={1333}

  alt="Buggy 2, Bohol"
/>

The photo is from the early stages, so my clothes are not dirty yet. However, the smell of gasoline, the sound of the buggy, and the clear weather all elevate my mood. 🚗⚡️️
There are many puddles, and it's generally safer to avoid them. But safety is boring.
Dare to **plunge into the puddles at full speed!** That's the pleasure of a buggy.

I got completely muddy (literally). There's no photo due to circumstances. There's a waterfall at the end, so I'll clean up there.
A change of clothes is a must!!!

I went to a place called Alona Beach. It was already evening, and I was exhausted from playing all day. I just swam and finished... I saw people paragliding. It looked fun, I wanted to do it, but I was too tired, so I just stared blankly. (laughs)

  height={1333}

  alt="tricycle, Bohol"
/>

For the first time, I took a tricycle (commonly known as: Tuk Tuk) to move for dinner.
The vehicle is simple, just a motorcycle and a sidecar with a roof on top.

In Bohol, many people travel by this vehicle, and there are many in the city.
The driving is rough as expected, and a bit dangerous.
I gave a lot of tips on the way back. They left with a very bright smile.

I had the famous dessert, Halo Halo. On top is purple yam?, with pineapple, yogurt, sherbet, and watermelon inside. This was a hit 😍 It was delicious!

On the morning of the 4th day, it's the main event, the wedding. The wedding is basically in English. They might have used the local language, Tagalog, but I only understand Japanese, so I didn't understand either way. (laughs)
It was my first time abroad, and it was very frustrating and disappointing that **I couldn't communicate because I didn't understand the language**. There were times when I was conversing through Google Translate, but it's only suitable for temporary conversations.
When I actually lived there, I felt like I could understand a little English.

It was also my first time attending a wedding. Is this what they call a winding road!!
I want to go through it someday.
※ I wanted to post a photo of the bride and groom, but I decided not to.
The wedding lasted for about 2 hours. Since I didn't understand any words, I only got the image of "priest's words → national anthem → photo shooting". (laughs)

In Filipino wedding receptions, there was a traditional culture where "**money is pinned to the couple's clothes with safety pins**" while they are dancing. When pinning money, you also need to dance. Since I had never danced in my life, I danced a **mysterious dance**, pinned the money, and immediately returned to my seat.
There was also an event for single people. Is this also a unique Filipino culture? Since I didn't understand the language at all, I didn't quite understand, but I managed to go with the flow.

# In conclusion

It felt more like a trip to the Philippines than a wedding trip. Since it was my first time attending a wedding and traveling abroad, I was very worried, but in the end, I had a great time. The toilet issue I was initially concerned about was just me worrying too much.

By knowing the outside world, I was able to re-recognize the obvious fact that I can evaluate my own world. Just as knowing other companies allows you to evaluate your own company, knowing foreign countries allows you to evaluate your own country.

Now, I'm going to share a very personal opinion. I think Japanese people strictly adhere to time, work seriously, and have a culture of living in harmony. Also, in Japan, I think it's good that general education like elementary and middle school is equally provided. Everyone has an equal chance to become anything.

What surprised me in the Philippines was that many people could speak not only their native language (Tagalog) but also English. I heard that it's normal to be able to speak multiple languages. I also heard that many people in Hong Kong can handle multiple languages. In Japan, we also learn a foreign language (English) in school, but the acquired ability seems to be low.

In the Philippines, where the gap between the rich and the poor is extreme, even the poorest people always had a smartphone. I found it very strange. I think they are probably using old smartphones, but I was puzzled about how they handle electricity and WiFi.

There were many discoveries on my trip to the Philippines, and it made me want to travel abroad again. However, I feel a little anxious if I don't go with someone familiar with the local area, like a tour. Therefore, if I travel abroad next time, I think I will choose from a tour. It was a very enjoyable trip!
