## Composition of Sentences to Input in Prompt

The sentences you input in Prompt should be structured in a way that is easy for AI to understand. This will make it easier for you to get the image you want.
The structure of the sentences is in the following format.

```
<Overall Format>
<Subject Matter>
<Subject Supplement>
<Author>
<Overall Supplement>
<Flavor>

例:
<Overall Format>Detailing oil painting of
<Subject Matter>The great white castle on deep forest landscape
<Author> by CASPAR DAVID FRIEDRICH and CLAUDE LORRAIN,
<Overall Supplement> perfect lighting, golden hour,
<Flavor> taken with Canon 5D Mk4
```
