I will introduce three recommended products that I found useful after actually using them!

# Smart home appliances? What's that?

Before I got hooked, I didn't understand the term "smart home appliances" very well, and I wasn't interested in it, thinking, "It's probably some kind of smart appliance (arbitrary)."

A conversation at a certain workplace triggered me to get more and more into smart home appliances due to their **convenience**, and I even regretted that "**I wish I had known about this earlier!**" From here on, I will introduce the following three smart home appliances!

- [Nature Remo](https://nature.global/jp/top)
- [Switch Bot](https://www.switchbot.jp/)
- [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/jp/magazine/compare_nest_speakers_displays?hl=ja-JP&srp=/jp/product/google_home_mini)

I'm not a shill, I promise (laughs)

## Recommendation 1: Nature Remo

Nature Remo transmits infrared signals on behalf of devices that are transmitting them. So, for example, if you were turning the lights ON/OFF with a remote control, Nature Remo will do it for you.

The good points of this are as follows:

- You can turn it ON/OFF from your smartphone, so you don't have to bother looking for the remote control.
- You can set a timer function and a series of actions, so it will automatically do things like "turn on the lights, air conditioner, and TV at 7 a.m."
- It can be linked with smart speakers such as Google Home and Alexa, so you can also control it by voice. (ok google, I'm home〜 → lights, air conditioner, and TV turn on)
- (I haven't used it, but) You can use humidity, temperature, brightness of the light, and distance from the smartphone as triggers.

## Recommendation 2: Switch Bot

Switch Bot will press physical buttons on your behalf. It supports physical buttons that could not be controlled by Nature Remo.

The good points of this are as follows:

- You can press or pull physical buttons from your smartphone.
- Timer and scheduling are also possible.
- It is firmly fixed with double-sided tape, so it can be used anywhere.

With this, you can press the button to boil the bath water while on your way home, so you can take a bath as soon as you get home!

※ The downside is that you cannot control it from outside your home without going through something called a [SwitchBot Hub](https://www.switchbot.jp/hub-plus).

## Recommendation 3: Google Home Mini

This is a product that even ignorant me knew about. It's a great device that supports Google Assistant by voice.

Also,

It can be linked with the Nature Remo and Switch Bot I introduced earlier, so you can operate it by voice instead of from your smartphone. This is very convenient, as you can just say "turn on the light" to Google Home Mini instead of the process of "open smartphone → tap app → operate".

Also, there is a "routine" that allows you to register a series of operations, so if you register "turn on the lights, turn on the air conditioner, turn on the TV" → "I'm home", just saying "ok google, I'm home" will turn on three appliances.

This combination of "nature remo + switchbot + google home mini" fits my lifestyle perfectly and has made things much easier.

## Conclusion

When I told a friend about this, he said, "Why don't you just do it yourself (lol)". However, for me who is deeply into it, there is no turning back. A life where I wake up in the morning, turn on the lights, turn on the air conditioner, and turn on the TV...

Rather, I'm searching on amazon for "Isn't there anything else convenient!?" (lol)

I hope you will come to appreciate the benefits of smart appliances.

## Recent Updates

Soon, a smart lock called Sesame will arrive at my home. This will make the key on your home door smart.
When this arrives, I'm thinking of writing an article again.
