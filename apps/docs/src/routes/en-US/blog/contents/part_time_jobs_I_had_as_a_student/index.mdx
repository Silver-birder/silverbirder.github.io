The job was to prepare a set of teaching materials (Japanese, math, etc.) for junior high school students for the new semester and transport them to the school. It was very easy.

## Art Museum Artwork Transportation

  - My sister worked at Mister Donut and brought home discarded donuts in Darth's box, which led me to start my part-time job. It was difficult to look at the donuts and ring them up at the cash register. It was also difficult to put the donuts neatly into the Darth's box. It was fun to wander around the store for coffee refills. There were many female part-timers, and I felt out of place.
