The year 2020 is now just around the corner. I'm going to leave a review of this year on my blog for the first time.

## Technology.

### UseCotlin

In March 2020, I started catching up on technology with my own tool [Cotlin](https://github.com/silverbirder/Cotlin). This tool is just a tool to collect technical materials (ex.speakerdeck,slideshare) posted on Twitter. In Japan, it is customary (as far as I have observed) to post technical study session materials on Twitter.
This habit can be used to discover a wide range of technical materials.

The following spreadsheet automatically registers technical material links.

I could discover not only Japanese but also foreign technical documents, so I could learn about technology from many different perspectives. For example, testing methods, architectural ideas and ways of working. I kept catching up with this every day without fail.

### Github Contribution

UseCotlin is mainly about technical input and not output. I tried to output every day so that I wouldn't become too much of an input headache.

I've tried to contribute almost every day - it's hard to find the right balance between Input and Output, but I'm glad I worked on it.

## Twitter Follower

ï¼ˆI started in September 2020, and I've gone from 1000 followers to almost 3000 followers.

## Life

### Marriage

On 22 November, at the age of 26, I got married for the first time.
My wife was someone I had been in a relationship with since university, and after a few twists and turns, including a break-up, I proposed to her and we got married. I finish work early and have a very good private life.

### Telecommuting and the IoT

Due to Corona, working from home has become the norm. Here are some of the best IoT purchases I've made this year.

- Smart Energy Hub Nature Remo E lite
  - Real-time visualisation of home electricity usage
- NETATMO Weather Station.
  - Real-time visualisation of home room temperature, humidity and Co2
- Arlo Camera
  - Camera visualisation of the front door and balcony
- Withings Sleep & Weight Scale
  - Measure sleep time and weight and visualise the data from your smartphone

## Aspirations for the coming year

In the past, I have been catching up with technology with gusto, but in 2021 I will try to strike a balance between technology and my personal life.

## In closing

I've made a lot of noise about Corona Corona this year, but next year I'd like to talk about more fun topics.
