Starting in February 2024, I began working as a freelance frontend engineer in the web industry, working four days a week. My working days are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. In this post, I reflect on these seven months and share my thoughts.

## Feelings on Each Day of the Week

I've summarized my feelings for each day under a four-day workweek.

- **Monday**
  - I don't feel particularly gloomy.
  - With the mindset of "If I work tomorrow, I get a day off," it's the most normal state.
- **Tuesday**  
  - A high-performance day!
  - The fact that "Tomorrow is a day off" boosts my motivation.
- **Wednesday**  
  - Day off.
  - As I'll explain later, this is when I refresh myself.
- **Thursday**  
  - Similar feeling to Monday.
  - Fatigue hasn't accumulated much.
- **Friday**  
  - Another high-performance day!
  - I unleash the energy stored up on Wednesday.

I have made it a habit to sunbathe and take a walk every morning, meditate, and do light jogging after work, which contributes to my mental and physical stability. Also, my daily rhythm doesn't change whether I'm working or off; I always go to bed and wake up at the same time.

## How I Spend Wednesdays

Wednesdays are days to take care of errands that can only be done on weekdays, such as going to government offices, banks, or hospitals. However, since I don't have these tasks every week, I also make it a habit to exercise by running about 8 km. I often do grocery shopping on weekdays to avoid crowds.

Additionally, I use this time creatively by working on development or writing blog posts based on notes I've left in Google Keep, and I enjoy watching movies or anime with my wife. Since commercial facilities are also empty on weekdays, it's a comfortable time for shopping and dining out.

## How I Spend Weekends

On weekends, I prioritize house cleaning and family time. My wife works part-time and often has weekends off, so we spend a lot of time together. We also often go shopping on weekends to coincide with family or friends' birthdays, anniversaries, seasonal events, or holidays.

## Advantages of a 4-Day Workweek

Personally, I think Japanese people work too much. Working five consecutive days puts a significant burden on both mind and body. It not only affects yourself but also those around you, and I feel that two days off on the weekend are not enough to recover from that burden.

A four-day workweek is just the right balance for me. Concentration is easier to maintain, and having breaks in between allows me to refresh, so fatigue and stress don't accumulate as much.

## Disadvantages and Countermeasures

Since my income becomes four-fifths of what it was when I worked five days a week, I need to be frugal. I also sometimes feel anxiety or impatience about the future. However, I might feel the same even if I worked five days a week. Therefore, I think it's important to save and invest properly and plan ahead.

## Future Outlook

I enjoy my current job and want to continue it for a long time. Rather than relentlessly pursuing technology, I believe it's important to continue at my own pace without overdoing it. I want to make the most of the flexibility of freelancing while prioritizing time with my family and doing what I love.

## Can Anyone Work a 4-Day Week?

In big cities like Tokyo, there are plenty of freelance jobs, but it might be difficult in rural areas unless remote work is possible. Since there are still few companies that allow full-time employees to work four days a week, being able to choose your working style as a freelancer is a significant advantage.
