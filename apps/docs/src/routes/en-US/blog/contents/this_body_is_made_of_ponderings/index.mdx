Mister Donut, a shop that produces the ultimate donuts.
I will talk about my encounter, parting, and reunion with Mister Donut.

## Encounter with Mister Donut

The encounter was my breakfast when I was a high school student living at my parents' house.
At that time, I had an older sister who was a college student, and she was working part-time at Mister Donut.
She was working the night shift at Mister Donut.
She would get a dozen box of donuts before they were discarded on her way home.
That was brought back to our house and became our breakfast.

I fell in love with the Angel French filled with fresh cream.
I ate it more like a dessert than bread.

From there, I fell into the swamp.

## Part-time job at Mister Donut

When I became a college student, I worked part-time at Mister Donut.
At that time, the people around me at the part-time job were all women, and I felt out of place.
Of course, I wanted to work the night shift.
In fact, I was allowed to work at night.

When I was working, I often found it difficult.

- Donuts do not have barcodes, so you have to remember the products and register them
  - Depending on the season, the products change rapidly
- You need to remember the procedure for making ramen and fried rice
- Occasionally, you are made to cosplay for the season
  - Like Halloween
- You have to go around the store for refill coffee

However, the best part was getting the donuts before they were discarded.

â€» Even now, "getting donuts before they are discarded" might be a taboo topic.

## Becoming a working adult and parting with Mister Donut

As I became a working adult, I had fewer opportunities to eat Mister Donut.
There was no Mister Donut near the office,
or even if there was, I was too busy with work to go.

## Eating Mister Donut again due to the spread of remote work

Around the time when remote work started to spread due to the Corona environment, I was moving.
I found a Mister Donut near my new place. Yay. The best.

## And now

Looking at my purchase history, it seems that I spend about 500 yen at Mister Donut once a week.

## Others (All-you-can-eat)

Mister Donut has an all-you-can-eat.

I actually went there, but I couldn't eat that much.
I thought it was just right to eat a little bit once in a while.
