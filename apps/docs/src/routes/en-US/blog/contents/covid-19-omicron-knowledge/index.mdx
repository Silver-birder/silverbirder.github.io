On January 24, 2022, I was infected with the Omicron variant. There was a lot I didn't know, so I thought I'd write about what I learned.

Please note that this is based on my personal experience, and I don't know if it's generally applicable.

## Conclusion

- The Omicron variant is indeed highly contagious
  - (Infected) Me
    - Received 2 doses of vaccine
    - Full remote work
    - No underlying diseases
    - Thorough hand washing and mask wearing
    - No dining out
  - Impressions
    - Whether you get infected or not seems to depend a lot on luck.
    - I thought it was important to take measures to prevent infection with the coronavirus (such as the Delta variant), but with Omicron, I think it's also important to prepare for after infection.
- The throat (pharynx) is **extremely painful**
  - One of the characteristics of the Omicron variant
  - Impressions
    - Swallowing saliva causes pain.
      - Especially at night, it becomes **excruciating**.
      - To avoid swallowing, I accumulate saliva or discard it with a tissue. (Put the tissue in a bag and close it properly)
    - It's important to keep your throat moist
      - Masks and throat lozenges are important.
- Symptoms are similar to those of influenza
  - Symptoms
    - Throat pain, high fever
    - No other symptoms (no loss of taste or smell)
  - **No severe symptoms**
  - Impressions
    - High fever can be adequately treated with medicine (Kakkonto, Calonal) prescribed at the clinic.
    - Thank you, Calonal.

## In conclusion

I still haven't received a call from the health center. The number of infections is increasing day by day, and the health center must be quite busy... Thank you for your hard work.
