After working on a mobile app for about three months, I ultimately decided to abandon the project.
In short, the **restrictions on iOS background execution** made it impossible to create what I envisioned.
In this article, I’ll share the development process and explain why I gave up. Whew, it was exhausting!

## Overview of the App I Wanted to Develop

The app I aimed to develop was a **shared alarm app**.
Since my family and I often wake up at the same time, I thought it would be convenient to have an app where we could share alarm times and days within a group.
While there are a few similar apps available, none fully met my needs, so I decided to create one myself.

Here’s a screenshot of the shared alarm app I actually built:

  layout="constrained"

/>

This shared alarm app allows you to set the alarm ON/OFF, time, days, sound, and volume.
You can also preview the sound and volume.

You can **share alarms without logging in**.
The person who creates the alarm becomes the owner and can share the alarm code with friends, allowing them to join the alarm.
When the owner changes the alarm time or days, all shared alarms are synced in real time.

## Technical Selection: Why React Native?

I chose React Native as the development language, primarily because **I’m familiar with React**.
Although there were other options like Flutter, Kotlin, or Swift, I didn’t want to invest the time in learning a new language.
Even if catching up is easy, the time required to learn the surrounding knowledge would be significant.
I simply wanted to focus on building the features I needed.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

I used React Native and adopted Expo, a framework for both Android and iOS.
The goal was to develop efficiently.
I primarily used the Expo SDK and added third-party libraries as needed.

The following libraries were added using the Expo SDK:

- **expo-background-fetch**: For background processing
- **expo-clipboard**: For copying the shared code
- **expo-task-manager**: For managing background tasks

The following third-party libraries were added:

- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage**: For storing data locally
- **@react-native-firebase/\***: Realtime Database, Messaging, Function
- **@notifee/react-native**: For notification management
- **@rneui/\***: UI toolkit
- **react-native-background-timer**: For background timers
- **react-native-modal-datetime-picker**: For date selection
- **react-native-picker-select**: For select boxes
- **react-native-notification-sounds**: To retrieve device sounds
- **react-native-track-player**: For audio playback
- **react-native-volume-manager**: For managing volume

I conducted tests using Android/iOS emulators.
However, some features (e.g., volume management) didn’t work on the emulator and required testing on a real device.

To run the app on a device, you can use an app called Expo Go, but some libraries do not work.
Therefore, I needed to build the app using EAS (Expo Application Services) and install it directly on the device.

On iOS, **a paid Apple Developer Program membership** is required to install apps on a device, and this process was quite cumbersome.
After applying, I didn’t receive a response for over a week, and only after following up did I get a reply two days later.
(Why do they respond so quickly when you follow up…?)

## Data and Alarm Triggers

The alarm time and volume data are stored in the following two places:

- Local storage
- Firebase Realtime Database

The reason for using Firebase Realtime Database is that it allows for easy synchronization of alarms across all users when alarms are shared.

Next, I’ll explain the triggers that cause the alarm to go off at the set time, divided into the following scenarios:

### When the App Is in the Background

Background refers to any of the following states:

- The device is locked
- The app is running but not visible on the screen
- The app is not running (shut down)

In this state, it’s difficult for the app to operate independently (especially on iOS…!!!),
so it needs to be triggered externally.
For this, I used FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and scheduled Firebase Function (internally using Cloud Scheduler) to run every minute,
sending a message to the target to trigger the alarm.

※ As mentioned later, sending a message every minute on iOS will trigger rate limits.

### When the App Is in the Foreground

Foreground means the app is open and visible on the screen.
In this state, the React Native components are mounted,
so the app checks the local storage data every five seconds and triggers the alarm accordingly.

## Functional Requirements and Challenges

The goal of the shared alarm app development was to meet the following requirements:

- **The ability to adjust the volume only during the alarm, even when the device is on mute (silent) or the volume is set to zero**
  - Reason: I don’t want to have to manually turn off mute and set the volume to maximum before using the alarm
- **The ability to sound the alarm even in the background**
  - Reason: I don’t want users to have to keep the app in the foreground to use the alarm
- **Support for both Android and iOS platforms**
  - Reason: My family uses both Android and iOS devices

### Issues with Alarm Sound

The alarm notification sound was implemented using `react-native-notification-sounds`, which used the device's built-in sounds.
However, a problem arose where the notification sound wouldn’t play in silent mode or when the volume was low.

To address this issue, I used `react-native-volume-manager` to control the volume.
While this worked in the foreground, the sound still wouldn’t play in the background.
I then introduced `react-native-track-player` to play audio,
which allowed for repeat playback and background audio playback.

This method partially solved the sound issue, but when adding sound to notifications (`@notifee/react-native`),
the problem of being inaudible in silent mode or at low volume persisted, so I ultimately abandoned this approach.

### iOS Background Execution Limitations

This was the **biggest reason I gave up**.
Running an app in the background on iOS is extremely challenging.

As described in the [Background Tasks - Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks),
using `BGAppRefreshTaskRequest` or `BGProcessingTaskRequest` makes it possible to perform certain tasks in the background.
However, I couldn’t find a way to keep the alarm running every minute for hours in the background.

I then tried using the method outlined in [Choosing Background Strategies - Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks/choosing-background-strategies-for-your-app),
which involves waking the app with a background push.
I scheduled Firebase Function to run every minute and used FCM to push data to wake the app.
I configured the push notification headers based on the following advice:

> When sending a background push, set content-available: to 1 without alert, sound, or badge.
> The system decides when to launch the app to download the content.
> To ensure your app launches, set apns-priority to 5, and apns-push-type to background.

However, the following limitation prevented this method from functioning as intended:

> If you send background pushes more frequently than three times per hour, the system imposes rate limitations.
> See Pushing background updates to your App for more information.

Due to this limitation, it was difficult to reliably trigger the alarm after a few minutes,
and I couldn’t achieve stable alarm operation.

It’s possible to avoid this by keeping the app in the foreground,
but I personally use Pokémon Sleep, so it’s not practical to use both apps simultaneously at night.
Pokémon Sleep requires you to leave the app in the foreground before going to bed.

Looking at [Configuring background execution modes | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-background-execution-modes),
there are potential methods to leverage location services or Bluetooth for alarms,
but I couldn’t come up with specific ideas.
It may be necessary to add background features like snoring recording or rolling-over detection.
There’s also the option of playing silent audio continuously, but this would likely drain the battery.

Here are some other useful links:

- [How do you allow tasks that take longer than the 30 seconds allowed in the background thread to continue performing until done? - Apple Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/695910)
- [iOS Background Execution Limits | Apple Developer Forums](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/685525)

For these reasons, I concluded that it’s extremely difficult to reliably trigger an alarm in the background on iOS.

By the way, I’m very curious about how the “Alarmy” app (known as “Alarmy - Wake Up Tasks”) manages to work effectively on iOS and how it solves this problem.

## What I Would Do Differently Next Time

This time, I chose React Native, and while the initial development speed was relatively fast,
I spent a lot of time troubleshooting.
I struggled to isolate whether issues were due to the app itself, the libraries, or native specifications.
I believe this is a common challenge with other cross-platform frameworks as well.

On the other hand, if I had used native languages like Kotlin or Swift,
some of these issues might have been easier to resolve.
Of course, even in native development, libraries are commonly used,
but I learned a lot from this experience.

Additionally, changing the requirements might have allowed for a different development approach.
For example, the app could have been developed by using notification sounds for the alarm.
By disabling mute and increasing the volume, it’s possible to use notification sounds.
However, since notification sounds only play once,
and considering the need for repeat play and compatibility with silent mode,
I wasn’t willing to compromise on the user experience I wanted.
As a result, I couldn’t change the requirements.
Perhaps a different perspective would have helped in finding a solution.
(I wish there was an alarm API...)

## Conclusion

Through this three-month experience, I realized the challenges of mobile app development.
The restrictions on iOS background execution were particularly stringent,
and they became a major obstacle to implementing the intended features.
If I come up with another idea I want to build, I’ll definitely give it another try!
